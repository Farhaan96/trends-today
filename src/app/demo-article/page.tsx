            Our Verdict
          </h3>
          <p className="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
            The iPhone 15 Pro Max represents the pinnacle of smartphone
            technology, combining exceptional performance with groundbreaking
            camera capabilities. While expensive, it delivers on almost every
            front.
          </p>

        <h2>Design and Build Quality</h2>
        <p>
          Apple has made significant improvements to the iPhone 15 Pro Max's
          design, most notably the switch from stainless steel to titanium. This
          change results in a lighter device that feels premium without being
          cumbersome. The brushed titanium finish not only looks sophisticated
          but also provides better grip than its predecessor.
        </p>

        <p>
          The new Action Button replaces the traditional mute switch, offering
          customizable functionality that extends beyond simple volume control.
          We found this particularly useful for quickly accessing the camera or
          flashlight.
        </p>

        <h2>Performance and A17 Pro Chip</h2>
        <p>
          The A17 Pro chip, built on a 3-nanometer process, delivers
          unprecedented performance for mobile computing. In our testing, the
          iPhone 15 Pro Max handled everything we threw at it, from intensive
          gaming to 4K video editing, without breaking a sweat.

        <h2>Camera System Excellence</h2>
        <p>
          The camera system on the iPhone 15 Pro Max is where Apple truly
          shines. The new 48MP main sensor, combined with improved computational
          photography, produces images that rival dedicated cameras. The 5x
          telephoto lens provides excellent zoom capabilities without
          significant quality loss.
        </p>

        <p>
          Night mode has been enhanced significantly, producing brighter, more
          detailed images in low-light conditions. The Action mode for video
          recording is particularly impressive, providing gimbal-like
          stabilization for dynamic shots.
        </p>

            Cons
          </h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2 text-red-800 dark:text-red-200">
            <li>• Premium pricing puts it out of reach for many users</li>
            <li>• Still no always-on display improvements</li>
            <li>• Limited customization compared to Android alternatives</li>
            <li>• No significant design changes from previous generation</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Battery Life and Charging</h2>
        <p>
          Battery life on the iPhone 15 Pro Max is excellent, easily lasting a
          full day of heavy usage. In our testing, the device consistently
          achieved 12-14 hours of screen time with mixed usage including gaming,
          photography, and video streaming.
        </p>

        <p>
          The switch to USB-C is welcome, though charging speeds remain
          conservative compared to Android competitors. Wireless charging via
          MagSafe continues to be convenient for overnight charging.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          The iPhone 15 Pro Max solidifies Apple's position at the top of the
          smartphone market. While the premium pricing remains a barrier, those
          who can afford it will find a device that excels in nearly every
          category. The combination of build quality, performance, and camera
          capabilities make it our top pick for users who demand the best.
        </p>

        <p>
          For most users, the standard iPhone 15 or 15 Plus will provide 90% of
          the experience at a more palatable price point. However, for
          photography enthusiasts and power users, the Pro Max justifies its
          premium with tangible benefits.
