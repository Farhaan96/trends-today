# 🎯 Balanced Batch Generation Guide

This guide ensures every article batch creates a perfectly balanced content portfolio across all categories instead of clustering in popular topics like technology and science.

## 📊 Current System Problem

**Before:** Batches randomly generated 3 articles that often clustered:

- Technology: 10 articles (20%)
- Science: 10 articles (20%)
- Space: 9 articles (18%)
- Culture: 8 articles (16%)
- Health: 7 articles (14%) 🔥 **NEEDS MORE**
- Psychology: 7 articles (14%) 🔥 **NEEDS MORE**

**After:** System automatically prioritizes underrepresented categories.

## 🚀 How to Generate Balanced Batches

### Step 1: Generate Your Batch Plan

```bash
node utils/balanced-batch-orchestrator.js plan 3
```

This gives you:

- 📊 Current distribution analysis
- 🎯 Optimal category selection (prioritizes gaps)
- 📝 Specific research queries per category
- 🤖 Ready-to-use Claude Code agent command

### Step 2: Copy & Execute the Agent Command

The system generates the exact command you need:

```
Use the trending-content-creator subagent to create a balanced batch of 3 articles with the following category distribution:

1. **HEALTH** (500-700 words)
   - Primary research: "precision medicine curing diseases thought incurable"
   - Secondary research: "CRISPR gene editing eliminating genetic disorders"
   - Focus areas: precision medicine breakthroughs targeting individual DNA, CRISPR gene editing curing previously incurable diseases

2. **PSYCHOLOGY** (500-700 words)
   - Primary research: "neuroscience explaining consciousness mysteries finally"
   - Secondary research: "brain research revealing procrastination causes"
   - Focus areas: neuroscience revealing how consciousness actually works, cognitive research explaining why we procrastinate

3. **CULTURE** (300-500 words)
   - Primary research: "creator economy hitting unprecedented billions in revenue"
   - Secondary research: "mass social media exodus to private communities"
   - Focus areas: creator economy reaching unprecedented scales, social media exodus to niche communities

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use Category Distribution Manager to verify this selection: node utils/category-distribution-manager.js balance 3
- Research each category with the provided queries for balanced topic discovery
- Create exactly ONE article per selected category
- Follow category-specific word count targets
- Ensure diverse topics across the batch (no clustering in similar themes)
- Apply all quality standards and SEO optimization per category requirements
```

### Step 3: Verify Results

After batch completion:

```bash
node utils/category-distribution-manager.js report
```

## 🎯 Different Batch Sizes

**3 Articles (Standard):**

```bash
node utils/balanced-batch-orchestrator.js plan 3
```

**5 Articles (Large Batch):**

```bash
node utils/balanced-batch-orchestrator.js plan 5
```

**Custom with Exclusions:**

```bash
node utils/balanced-batch-orchestrator.js plan 4 "technology,space"
```

## 📈 How Category Selection Works

### Priority Algorithm

1. **Content Gap Analysis** - Categories with fewer articles get highest priority
2. **Balance Score** - Distance from perfect distribution (8.5 articles per category)
3. **Strategic Growth** - Ensures steady progress toward balance

### Example Selection Logic

**Current State:**

- Health: 7 articles → Priority: 🔥 High (2.5)
- Psychology: 7 articles → Priority: 🔥 High (2.5)
- Culture: 8 articles → Priority: ⚡ Medium (1.5)
- Science: 10 articles → Priority: 📝 Low (1.0)

**Selected for Next Batch:** Health, Psychology, Culture

## 🏆 Perfect Balance Target

**Goal Distribution (51 articles total):**

- Each category: ~8-9 articles
- Range: ≤2 articles difference between highest and lowest

**Current Progress:**

```
Health:     7 articles ████████████▌   [PRIORITY]
Psychology: 7 articles ████████████▌   [PRIORITY]
Culture:    8 articles █████████████▌  [MEDIUM]
Space:      9 articles ██████████████▌ [LOW]
Science:   10 articles ███████████████▌[LOW]
Technology:10 articles ███████████████▌[LOW]
```
