## Major comfort improvements expected

Apple is reportedly addressing the biggest complaint about the original Vision Pro: comfort. Sources within the supply chain indicate the Vision Pro 2 will be 40% lighter than its predecessor, achieved through a redesigned battery system and lighter materials. The new model allegedly features a balanced weight distribution that eliminates the front-heavy feeling that plagued early adopters.

The redesigned head strap system draws inspiration from high-end audio headphones, with premium padding and multiple adjustment points. Beta testers report being able to wear the device for 3-4 hours without discomfort, a significant improvement over the current model's typical 90-minute comfort window.

## Revolutionary battery solution

One of the most exciting developments is Apple's new approach to power management. Instead of the external battery pack, the Vision Pro 2 reportedly integrates a slim battery into the rear head strap, similar to the Meta Quest Pro design. This eliminates the awkward cable while maintaining the same 2-hour active use battery life.

The integrated battery supports hot-swapping through magnetic attachment points, allowing users to replace depleted batteries without removing the headset. Apple is also introducing a "developer mode" that provides continuous power through USB-C, making it ideal for extended work sessions or content creation.

## Display and performance upgrades

The Vision Pro 2 maintains the micro-OLED displays but increases the field of view by 20%, addressing another common criticism. The new displays support 120Hz refresh rates in all modes, up from the selective 90Hz/96Hz implementation in the original. This improvement significantly reduces motion sickness and enhances the overall immersion.

Apple's next-generation R2 chip promises 2x the graphics performance while consuming 30% less power. This enables more complex applications and improved passthrough quality. The enhanced processing power also supports Apple's new "Persona 2.0" avatars, which feature photorealistic facial expressions and body language.

## Competitive pricing strategy

Perhaps the most significant change is Apple's pricing strategy. Industry insiders suggest the Vision Pro 2 will launch at $2,499, a substantial reduction from the original's $3,499 starting price. This aggressive pricing aims to expand the market beyond early adopters and developers.

Apple is also planning a trade-in program for original Vision Pro owners, offering up to $1,500 credit toward the new model. Combined with educational discounts and payment plans, this could make spatial computing accessible to a much broader audience. The question remains: will these improvements be enough to mainstream mixed reality?
