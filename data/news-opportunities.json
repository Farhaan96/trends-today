When getting to work on the remake, Maehiro and his team discovered they had to rebuild the source code from the ground up since it was lost thanks to the industry s unstandardized practices in the 90s, according to Bloomberg. When translating Final Fantasy Tactics from Japanese to English for the global release, the company would overwrite the original Japanese version s code. For Maehiro, that meant the team had to undertake a ground-up overhaul and recreate the source code by playing the original game that released in 1997, consulting the game s master disc and looking at the 2011 version called Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, according to Bloomberg. Maehiro also said during a PAX West 2025 panel that the team gleaned a lot of lost info from fan-made databases. Revealing more of the behind-the-scenes decisions for The Ivalice Chronicles, Maehiro told Bloomberg about the debate surrounding Count Cidolfus Orlandeau. Better known as Cid, and appropriately nicknamed Thunder God Cid, this overtuned character joins you later in the game, but many fans complained about him being overpowered. Instead of nerfing Cid, Maehiro told Bloomberg that keeping this character s power level the same would better represent the storyline since his role in the story is being that very powerful character who joins your party. To quell any concerns of Cid being too broken, Maehiro told Bloomberg that the team decided to buff the other characters to even things out. Looking ahead, Maehiro also hinted at exploring sequels for the Final Fantasy Tactics franchise or even brand new games in the strategy RPG genre, given that The Ivalice Chronicles does well, according to Bloomberg.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-ivalice-chronicles-team-had-to-remake-the-original-final-fantasy-tactics-source-code-from-scratch-190253342.html?src=rss]]>",

    "description": "It s September, and that usually means it s iPhone season. Like clockwork, Apple once again appears set to show off new smartphones with its latest showcase next week. The upcoming event has been dubbed Awe dropping, so we re hoping for a few announcements that ll warrant the tagline. The showcase begins on September 9 at 1PM ET/10AM PT. If you want to tune in to hear what Tim Cook and crew have to say about the presumed iPhone 17, you can stream the show on Apple s website or YouTube channel. We ve also got the livestream embedded below so you can follow along with our liveblog while you watch. With just a few days to go until the Awe dropping event, it seems like we ve already gotten a lot of advanced insights about what the iPhone 17 lineup has in store. Apple introduced the software side of the equation with the iOS 26 unveil at WWDC this summer, and since then we ve gotten some pretty reliable insights on the hardware. The big reveal is expected to be an ultralight smartphone, likely called the iPhone 17 Air. This would be Apple s first application of its Air nomenclature for mobile, and when we had Bloomberg s Mark Gurman on the Engadget Podcast at the end of August, he suggested that the first iteration of the smartphone might come with some growing pains. We also anticipate seeing a base iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max. Beyond the smartphones, the Awe dropping event could also include three new Apple Watches and updated AirPods Pro earbuds. Bloomberg reports that Apple has several other devices in the works as well, including a new AirTag, Apple TV and iPad Pro, but it s not as certain if those will pop up at this specific event. Either way, you can tune in on September 9 to hear about all the new product launches.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-watch-apple-debut-the-iphone-17-lineup-at-its-awe-dropping-event-on-september-9-130040222.html?src=rss]]>",

    "description": "Starting September 9, Porsche and Audi will be the latest non-Tesla brands to utilize the Supercharger network. The two automakers announced that some of their owners will get adapters that allow them to charge via the NACS port, which Tesla developed and opened up to other automakers. The rollout comes after the Volkswagen Group, which owns both Porsche and Audi, announced that it would implement NACS compatibility for Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and Scout Motors in December 2023. Porsche / Ashton Stan Porsche is kicking off its NACS adoption with a soft launch, where existing owners of Taycan and Macan Electric models have to reserve a free NACS to DC adapter with the My Porsche app to connect to the Tesla Supercharger network. During this initial phase, drivers of compatible Porsche EVs have to use the Tesla app at Superchargers, but will eventually be able to charge with the My Porsche app in the coming months, according to Porsche. Like Porsche, Audi is getting its own branded adapter that will arrive with newer 2025 model year options, including its Q6 e-tron, A6 Sportback e-tron and e-tron GT. Notably, Audi said its Q4 e-tron won t currently have access to Tesla Superchargers. For Porsche, any Taycan and Macan Electric from model year 2026 onward will include a free NACS adapter. However, Porsche EVs from model year 2024 or older will have to buy the adapter from Porsche s online shop or dealerships, which will go for $185. Porsche and Audi are also working on software updates to show Tesla Superchargers on their navigation systems. Despite Porsche and Audi now gaining access to the Supercharger network, Volkswagen Group s other subsidiaries, including Lamborghini and Bentley, still haven t committed to adopting NACS.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/porsche-and-audis-evs-can-now-recharge-on-any-tesla-supercharger-in-north-america-173333649.html?src=rss]]>",

    "description": "No matter how old you get, the back-to-school season will always bring a desire to shop. So, sales at this time of year are always more than welcome — especially when they're on some of our favorite devices. Such is the case with the 20 percent discount on the Sonos Era 300. The spatial-audio speaker is on sale for $359 right now, down from $449. It's part of a larger sale that's both for Labor Day and back to school, discounting speakers, soundbars and more by up to 20 percent. The same price is available on Amazon, as are some more deals on Sonos products. Sonos debuted the Era 300 in 2023 as its main spatial audio offering, and we found it to have excellent sound quality, a simple setup process and Trueplay tuning that's super easy to use. It works with basically any music streaming service you could have, and if you simply must have spatial audio support in your next speaker, you'll be hard pressed to find a better option. It's worth mentioning that the Sonos Ace headphones are also on sale for $299, down from $399 — a 25 percent discount. The headphones have come a long way since they first launched, including the introduction of TrueCinema, which works with a Sonos soundbar to create the best spatial audio experience.

    "description": "Sometimes, rising prices for streaming services feels as inevitable as death and taxes. So when a serious discount is available, we tend to sit up and take notice. For a few weeks, you can get a whopping half off an annual subscription to Paramount+. A year of the Paramount+ Essential plan, which is ad-supported, will cost $30 compared to the usual $60. Paramount+ Premium, which is ad-free except for live tv programming, will cost $60 for a year instead of $120. This is a substantial deal that both new and returning subscribers can take advantage of; it's not uncommon for this type of serious discount to only be offered to a first-timer. Anyone who signs up for a year-long subscription to Paramount+ from now through September 18 will be able to get this pricing. The only real caveat with this deal is that you have to pay for the full year in advance; month-to-month subscriptions will still cost the usual rate. Paramount+ has some great programming options, particularly if you're a fan of anything involving RuPaul. It's also the home of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Star Trek: Lower Decks, which are arguably the best modern additions to the sci-fi show's canon, as well as the other past and present Star Trek series. The platform offers a solid lineup of sports as well. And if you opt to go for the Premium plan, you'll also be granted access to Showtime titles such as Yellowjackets and the rebooted Dexter: Resurrection.

    "description": "While scientists are still working to understand the effects an extended trip to space can have on the human body, research in recent years has suggested that astronauts may experience some pretty dramatic changes on both the physiological and psychological levels. In the latest study led by a team at University of California San Diego, researchers found signs of accelerated aging in human stem cells that spent roughly a month in space. The research focused on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which are crucial in the formation of blood and immune cells. Stem cells were sent to the International Space Station for stays of 32-45 days using specially developed nanobioreactors to monitor them. Another set remained on Earth at the Kennedy Space Center. The cells that went to the ISS showed a host of changes, including reduced self-renewal abilities, greater susceptibility to DNA damage and inflammation in the mitochondria. However, the damage didn t appear to be permanent. The team notes that the changes were at least partially reversed when the cells were removed from the space environment. “Space is the ultimate stress test for the human body,” Catriona Jamieson, director of the UC San Diego Sanford Stem Cell Institute, said in a statement. “These findings are critically important because they show that the stressors of space — like microgravity and cosmic galactic radiation — can accelerate the molecular aging of blood stem cells. Understanding these changes not only informs how we protect astronauts during long-duration missions but also helps us model human aging and diseases like cancer here on Earth.

    "description": "We're only a few days away from Apple's iPhone 17 event, which the company has titled \"awe dropping\" and will air on Tuesday, September 9. If all goes as expected, we should be able to download iOS 26 and iPad 26 about a week later. Coming with those OS updates are substantial changes to your iPhone and iPad's software. You may have already heard about \"Liquid Glass,\" which (intentional or not) is sort of like Apple's take on the old Windows Vista design language. That's the most notable change, but we spent two weeks test-driving many of the other features included in the update — you can check out our hands-on iOS 26 preview for more impressions, or you can try the software out yourself by downloading and installing the latest public beta. The public beta is a more stable iteration of the update than the developer version, which recently hit the beta 9 waypoint and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (Though it's worth remembering that there's a degree of risk involved with installing any form of beta software.) Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26. While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025, as a few models are getting the axe this time around. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to receive the boot in 2023, and this year iPhones released in 2018 will be left behind. If your device is ineligible, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. You can find a full list of iPhones and iPads that will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 below. To see everything that's coming with the latest OS updates, you can check out our big rundown of what to expect. These three iOS 18 iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26 Unlike last year, a trio of iPhones won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut in September. These three models that were first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party: iPhone XR iPhone XS iPhone XS Max iPhones compatible with iOS 26 While we don't know exactly which new iPhones Apple plans to drop on September 9 — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site, that the devices listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. In short, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e iPads compatible with iPadOS 26 Meanwhile, the iPads listed below are eligible to download iPadOS 26: iPad Pro (M4) iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later) iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later) iPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3) iPad (8th generation and later, including A16) iPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro) What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone? If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers. When will iOS 26 become available? Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. If it follows suit this year, we should have access to the new operating system on Tuesday, Sept. 16 — exactly one week after the event. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event on September 9. iOS 26 features we're excited about Liquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music. Live Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. Polls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend. New lock screen options: More customizable iPhone lock screen options are coming with iOS 26, including a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Snooze longer (or shorter): Say goodbye to the 9-minute snooze setting in your alarms (if you want). You'll soon have the option to change your snooze time from one to 15 minutes. Fresh Camera app design: You'll find the Camera app is simpler to navigate in iOS 26, with all the buttons and menus located in convenient spots. That means less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens is too dirty. Screenshot revamps: When you take a screenshot, you'll have the option to search for the image on Google (maybe you're looking for a sweater you saw on a celeb) and you can ask ChatGPT questions about the photo — all from the edit screen. It's like a reverse image search but without all the hard work.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-ios-26-release-date-is-coming-up-check-to-see-if-your-iphone-is-compatible-for-the-update-191854907.html?src=rss]]>",

That means we should finally get the skinny on the presumed iPhone 17 lineup — including the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air — in less than a week. (In the meantime, we have a breakdown of how you can watch the iPhone 17 launch.) Assuming Apple sticks to tradition, this also means we should be able to install iOS 26 about a week or so after the showcase. But you don't have to wait to test out the new features, since you can download and install the newly released public beta 6 or iOS 26 developer beta 9. (See our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release for more info.) The first thing you'll notice is a new clear design language Apple dubs Liquid Glass. The translucent look can be found within apps as well as your lock and home screens. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements with iOS 26. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. It seems like additional new improvements are popping up (or at least hinted at) with each beta, such as an AirPods live translation feature and a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center. Some of those changes have already migrated into the separate public beta. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). We've rounded up a full list of new features coming this fall below. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, which Apple is still actively updating — version 18.6.1 was released last month, for example, to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released iOS 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download. But don't expect to ever see an iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping its naming convention ahead to iOS 26. (Apple is also expected to release iOS 18.7 at the same time, per MacRumors, to address security issues.) The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: The company says Liquid Glass was designed to make all of its platforms more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's been frustrated with last year's changes to the Photos app, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. Camera app updates: Navigating the Camera app should be simpler in iOS 26, as all the buttons and menus are in convenient spots — less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens needs to be cleaned. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. New alarm setting: You'll no longer be stuck with the 9-minute snooze setting in your alarms. Instead, you'll have the option to change your snooze time from one to 15 minutes. Screenshots look different: You'll notice several new features when you take a screenshot, including \"highlight to search,\" the option to search your image on Google and ChatGPT is there for any questions you have about the image. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. There's more beyond that, so be sure to check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Heart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates. Will Siri get an update? Siri is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a \"stripped-down\" AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones from 2019 or later will be eligible for iOS 26: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the four presumed iPhone 17 models that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings General Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.

    "description": "Microsoft said its Azure cloud platform has returned to normal service after an incident of cut underwater cables that played out over Saturday. The tech giant reported undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea on Saturday morning, which disrupted Azure service throughout the Middle East and led to potential increased latency for users. Microsoft said that the latency issue was resolved by Saturday evening and was able to reroute the Azure traffic through other paths. Microsoft didn t provide a reason for why the undersea cables were cut. These cables sit on the ocean floor and play the crucial role of delivering massive amounts of data across the world. While ships dropping anchors can sometimes damage undersea cables, there have been more intentional circumstances in the past. In 2024, the internationally recognized government of Yemen claimed that the country s Houthi movement was responsible for cutting cables in the Red Sea. While Microsoft managed to restore service for its latest episode the same day, it also noted that undersea cable cuts can take time to repair and that it will continuously monitor, rebalance, and optimize routing to reduce customer impact in the meantime.

    "description": "In less than 48 hours, Apple will finally begin its big September Awe dropping iPhone event, and we ll get our official look at the long-anticipated iPhone 17 lineup. The hardware announcement will take place on September 9 at 1PM ET, and the Engadget team will be liveblogging it from Cupertino in real-time. (You can watch the iPhone 17 event on YouTube, too.) The newest phones will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled, along with any new features Apple reveals that day. So what can we expect to see? While Apple keeps all the details under lock and key, we actually have a very strong idea as to what we ll be seeing, thanks to leaks from Asian supply chains, case manufacturers and some credible media reports. Oh, and there are plenty of more fanciful rumors, too. Here s our best bet as to what will be coming out of Cupertino next in just a few days. What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors? Bloomberg s Mark Gurman is the industry s best-known Apple whisperer, and his event preview offers a tidy overview of what to expect on Tuesday. That includes four new iPhone 17 models, with an all-new superthin model, dubbed the iPhone Air, leading the pack. We ll also likely see the baseline iPhone 17, as well as the usual Pro and big-screen Pro Max models, which will offer the line s best cameras and extras. Additionally, expect up to three new Apple Watch models, with the satellite-connected Apple Watch Ultra 3 and a possible new entry-level Apple Watch SE flanking the Apple Watch Series 11. Rounding out the new products should be the AirPods Pro 3 earbuds, which are said to add heart-rate monitoring and a live translation feature. While all of those reports largely jibe with earlier rumors, Gurman s report includes screen sizes and handset sizes down to the millimeter. In fact, he had previously outlined most of the same expectations in a recent appearance on the Engadget Podcast. But he s not the only one with exact measurements: Plenty of case makers, including Dbrand, have unveiled their cases for the complete iPhone 17 line, further solidifying expectations on dimensions and screen sizes for the new models. That said, we re still treating everything as unconfirmed until Apple s official announcements hit on Tuesday. While we don t expect any big leaps forward on the Apple Intelligence front at Tuesday s event, Gurman s subsequent report notes that Apple is continuing to experiment with AI models from Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, and may license technology from one or more of them ahead of a major Siri upgrade that could arrive as soon as March 2026. How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple s announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from PlayStations to Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers. But given that President Trump s trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple s continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an upgrade. Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as Instant Digital, suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50, Apple could at least pitch it as a better value. That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. Now, on the eve of the iPhone announcement, a report from JPMorgan mixes and matches the rumors above. As recounted in 9to5Mac, the iPhone line s starting prices will still stretch from $799 to $1,199 — just as they do now — with the Air possibly getting a $50 increase versus the iPhone Plus model it s replacing, and the 17 Pro costing an additional $100, but including more storage. Again, these prices are only projections and haven t been confirmed by Apple. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? As noted above, the date has been confirmed for Tuesday, September 9. That lines up with Apple s traditional schedule, and the earlier report from iphone-ticker.de (via MacRumors). This generation of Apple smartphones may be the last to be fully released in September, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple s ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg s Mark Gurman reported in January (and reaffirmed in his September event preview) that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It will also supposedly use Apple s new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. As a guest on the latest Engadget Podcast, Gurman told Engadget s Devindra Hardawar and Igor Bonifacic the rumored iPhone Air will be rough around the edges at first. He believes the 17 Air will lag in both when it comes to camera and battery performance. The battery life is going to be subpar compared to a base-level 17 or Pro model, he says. The ultimate goal, he notes, is to get all the functionality of the Pro models into the Air models. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is lighter. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report said the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air s battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors noted. (That s below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won t take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. On a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors. Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight. That same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a hit-or-miss leaker, suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro s supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can t knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we re hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Leaker Majin Bu also claims TechWoven cases could be introduced, per a MacRumors report. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for convenient and secure carrying, so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange. Additionally, he said there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black. He also recently showed a clear iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max case with the large rear camera bump cutout. The case isn t fully transparent and instead has a white rectangular piece that covers the MagSafe area. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width camera island on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 spotted in the wild. The pics, highlighted on MacRumors, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 Additionally, the iPhone 17 Pro‌ models could have the brightest display yet, according to leaker Instant Digital, MacRumors reports. The goal is to make it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods. The article points out that existing 16 Pro models can double their maximum brightness while in direct sunlight, making it easier to see what s on the screen. We ve also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. Bloomberg s Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he confirmed in his August 24 Power On newsletter. On July 30, Tom s Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing dummy iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it s interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. To add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it s important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e. What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it s released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they ll be running on iOS 26. On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm. The next iOS is now available as a public beta. Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They ll all run watchOS 26, of course.) As noted above, a new version of the Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022) is expected, and there s a possibility we ll see new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021), though those could be announced later. The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm in mid-August thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors, it s a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV, HomePod mini, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don t expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs), so there s always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.

    "description": "For most Hollow Knight: Silksong players, the combat is challenging and the boss fights are punishing. However, there s another layer of complexity for anyone playing the sequel in Simplified Chinese: the bizarre translations. On its Steam store page, Silksong currently sits at a Mostly Positive rating across reviews in all languages. Once you filter for the Simplified Chinese reviews, the Metroidvania-style game plummets to Mostly Negative. There are plenty of complaints about Silksong being too hard and not rewarding enough, but the translation issues are a common theme across the reviews for Simplified Chinese. In the reviews and comments, players compared the translations to a jarring mix of ancient and modern Chinese. Tiger Tang, who worked on the Simplified Chinese translation of an indie RPG called OMORI, posted on X that the translation reads like a Wuxia novel instead of conveying the game’s tone, referencing the literary genre that features martial arts and is often set in ancient China. The good news is that the team behind Silksong is aware of the translation issues, as indicated by Matthew Griffin, who handles the game s marketing and publishing. Griffin posted on X that the team is aware of quality issues with the current Simplified Chinese translation and that they are working to improve the translation over the coming weeks. When looking at the original Hollow Knight, the reviews are overwhelmingly positive, even when looking at the Simplified Chinese reviews. However, Silksong credits a team of two for its Chinese localization, while the original featured six.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/silksong-reviews-drop-to-mostly-negative-for-chinese-players-due-to-confusing-translations-162631762.html?src=rss]]>",

    "description": "Bluesky has added a built-in bookmarking feature so users finally have a way to privately save posts on the platform. The update is out now on Bluesky s website and app.Bookmarks on Bluesky work pretty much like they do on any other service. Save a post and you can revisit it later from the saved posts section of the app and website. It s overall a basic feature — there s currently no way to organize your saves into folders, for example — but it s a very long overdue addition to the platform. Up to now, Bluesky users have technically been able to save posts via a workaround. Bluesky developer Jaz created a custom pinned feed that allowed subscribers to save posts by replying with a 📌 emoji. But while this provided a handy way to save posts in the absence of an official bookmarking feature, it wasn t private since it created a public reply for every save. Now, though, there s a handy tool to convert your previously pinned posts into private bookmarks. You can also opt to delete your public pins or leave them as is.

    "description": "Rimac Technology has unveiled a new battery pack platform for electric vehicles that uses only solid-state batteries. The company has been an EV supplier for notable car brands including Aston Martin and Koenigsegg, as well as making electric supercar Nevara. Rimac collaborated with ProLogium and Mitsubishi Chemical Group on the product, which it claims will offer a lighter, safer and more energy-dense EV battery. It introduced this tech, alongside new composite and hybrid battery EV developments, at the IAA Mobility 2025 event. Solid-state batteries are being touted as an important new development for EVs. European R D operation Imec released a study into this tech last year that backed claims that these batteries did indeed have the potential to improve efficiency while bringing down costs. However, the commercial development of solid-state batteries has been slow going. Despite a flurry of partnerships several years ago, the targets for getting EVs fully powered by the tech onto the road may still be some time away. For instance, Nissan said it aims to have its first EV solely using solid-state batteries released by its 2028 fiscal year. Rimac didn t offer even a rough timeline for when it might have its new battery tech available for customers.

    "description": "Tomorrow, September 9, marks Apple's iPhone 17 event. That means we'll finally have more answers about the presumed iPhone 17 lineup — including the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air. Interested in following along? Here's how you can watch the iPhone 17 launch. Assuming Apple sticks to tradition, we should be able to install iOS 26 about a week or so after the showcase. But you don't have to wait to test out the new features, since you can download and install the newly released public beta 6 or iOS 26 developer beta 9. (See our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release for more info.) The first thing you'll notice is a new clear design language Apple dubs Liquid Glass. The translucent look can be found within apps as well as your lock and home screens. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements with iOS 26. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. It seems like additional new improvements are popping up (or at least hinted at) with each beta, such as an AirPods live translation feature and a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center. Some of those changes have already migrated into the separate public beta. Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). We've rounded up a full list of new features coming this fall below. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, which Apple is still actively updating — version 18.6.1 was released last month, for example, to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released iOS 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download. But don't expect to ever see an iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping its naming convention ahead to iOS 26. (Apple is also expected to release iOS 18.7 at the same time, per MacRumors, to address security issues.) The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: The company says Liquid Glass was designed to make all of its platforms more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's been frustrated with last year's changes to the Photos app, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. Camera app updates: Navigating the Camera app should be simpler in iOS 26, as all the buttons and menus are in convenient spots — less swiping, more photo taking. Plus, there's a new feature that tells you if your lens needs to be cleaned. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. New alarm setting: You'll no longer be stuck with the 9-minute snooze setting in your alarms. Instead, you'll have the option to change your snooze time from one to 15 minutes. Screenshots look different: You'll notice several new features when you take a screenshot, including \"highlight to search,\" the option to search your image on Google and ChatGPT is there for any questions you have about the image. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. There's more beyond that, so be sure to check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26. What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Heart rate monitoring (rumored for now): Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates. Will Siri get an update? Siri is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a \"stripped-down\" AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones from 2019 or later will be eligible for iOS 26: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the four presumed iPhone 17 models that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings General Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta. A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.

    "description": "Vodafone made a commercial starring an AI avatar posing as a real lady. This is interesting because Vodafone is a major global brand and not a fly-by-night TikTok company using a ridiculous deepfake of Jackson Galaxy to sell cat toys. The tells in the commercial are obvious and what one would expect. The AI avatar s hair is a bit off, which ruins the charade that this is a real person. The physical mannerisms and speaking tone are also wonky. A facial mole moves around at one point. It s AI. You know the drill. The company responded to a question on a message board as to why it couldn t put a real person in front of the camera by saying this is simply an experiment. It said it was “testing different styles of advertising — this time with AI,” and that “AI is so much a part of everyday life these days that we also try it out in advertising.” This isn t the first Vodafone ad to feature generative AI. It released a fully AI-generated commercial last year that spurred a bit of controversy, despite looking absolutely awful. Social media platforms are also becoming increasingly littered with AI-generated virtual influencers.

    "description": "The arrival of September means it s officially iPhone season. And tomorrow, Apple is finally going to showcase its latest iPhone 17 lineup, allowing us to separate fact from rumor once and for all. Apple has dubbed the upcoming event Awe dropping, so we re hoping for several big announcements that ll warrant the tagline. The debut begins on September 9 at 1PM ET/10AM PT. If you want to tune in to hear what Tim Cook and crew have to say about the presumed iPhone 17, you can stream the show on Apple s website or YouTube channel. We ve also got the livestream embedded below so you can follow along with our liveblog if you re unable to watch the event. With just a few days to go until the Awe dropping event, it seems like we ve already gotten a lot of advanced insights about what the iPhone 17 lineup has in store. Apple introduced the software side of the equation with the iOS 26 unveil at WWDC this summer, and since then we ve gotten some pretty reliable insights on the hardware. The big reveal is expected to be an ultralight smartphone, likely called the iPhone 17 Air. This would be Apple s first application of its Air nomenclature for mobile, and when we had Bloomberg s Mark Gurman on the Engadget Podcast at the end of August, he suggested that the first iteration of the smartphone might come with some compromises — specifically, a smaller battery and fewer cameras, to better accommodate its svelte frame. We also anticipate seeing a base iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max, all of which should offer more iterative upgrades to last year s iPhone 16 line. Beyond the smartphones, the Awe dropping event could also include three new Apple Watches and updated AirPods Pro earbuds. Gurman, again reporting for Bloomberg, notes that Apple has several other devices in the works as well, including a new AirTag, Apple TV and iPad Pro, but it s not as certain if those will pop up at this specific event. Either way, you can tune in on September 9 to hear about all the new product launches.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-watch-apple-debut-the-iphone-17-lineup-at-its-awe-dropping-event-tomorrow-130040078.html?src=rss]]>",
