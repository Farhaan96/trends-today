    "description": "The Square Enix team behind Final Fantasy Tactics — The Ivalice Chronicles didn t just remaster the iconic strategy RPG, they had to go through the trouble of remaking the source code from scratch, according to Bloomberg. In an interview with Bloomberg s Jason Schreier, the game s director Kazutoyo Maehiro explained the arduous process of designing The Ivalice Chronicles, which is set to release at the end of the month. When getting to work on the remake, Maehiro and his team discovered they had to rebuild the source code from the ground up since it was lost thanks to the industry s unstandardized practices in the 90s, according to Bloomberg. When translating Final Fantasy Tactics from Japanese to English for the global release, the company would overwrite the original Japanese version s code. For Maehiro, that meant the team had to undertake a ground-up overhaul and recreate the source code by playing the original game that released in 1997, consulting the game s master disc and looking at the 2011 version called Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, according to Bloomberg. Maehiro also said during a PAX West 2025 panel that the team gleaned a lot of lost info from fan-made databases. Revealing more of the behind-the-scenes decisions for The Ivalice Chronicles, Maehiro told Bloomberg about the debate surrounding Count Cidolfus Orlandeau. Better known as Cid, and appropriately nicknamed Thunder God Cid, this overtuned character joins you later in the game, but many fans complained about him being overpowered. Instead of nerfing Cid, Maehiro told Bloomberg that keeping this character s power level the same would better represent the storyline since his role in the story is being that very powerful character who joins your party. To quell any concerns of Cid being too broken, Maehiro told Bloomberg that the team decided to buff the other characters to even things out. Looking ahead, Maehiro also hinted at exploring sequels for the Final Fantasy Tactics franchise or even brand new games in the strategy RPG genre, given that The Ivalice Chronicles does well, according to Bloomberg.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-ivalice-chronicles-team-had-to-remake-the-original-final-fantasy-tactics-source-code-from-scratch-190253342.html?src=rss]]>",

    "description": "It s September, and that usually means it s iPhone season. Like clockwork, Apple once again appears set to show off new smartphones with its latest showcase next week. The upcoming event has been dubbed Awe dropping, so we re hoping for a few announcements that ll warrant the tagline. The showcase begins on September 9 at 1PM ET/10AM PT. If you want to tune in to hear what Tim Cook and crew have to say about the presumed iPhone 17, you can stream the show on Apple s website or YouTube channel. We ve also got the livestream embedded below so you can follow along with our liveblog while you watch. With just a few days to go until the Awe dropping event, it seems like we ve already gotten a lot of advanced insights about what the iPhone 17 lineup has in store. Apple introduced the software side of the equation with the iOS 26 unveil at WWDC this summer, and since then we ve gotten some pretty reliable insights on the hardware. The big reveal is expected to be an ultralight smartphone, likely called the iPhone 17 Air. This would be Apple s first application of its Air nomenclature for mobile, and when we had Bloomberg s Mark Gurman on the Engadget Podcast at the end of August, he suggested that the first iteration of the smartphone might come with some growing pains. We also anticipate seeing a base iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max. Beyond the smartphones, the Awe dropping event could also include three new Apple Watches and updated AirPods Pro earbuds. Bloomberg reports that Apple has several other devices in the works as well, including a new AirTag, Apple TV and iPad Pro, but it s not as certain if those will pop up at this specific event. Either way, you can tune in on September 9 to hear about all the new product launches.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-watch-apple-debut-the-iphone-17-lineup-at-its-awe-dropping-event-on-september-9-130040222.html?src=rss]]>",

    "description": "Starting September 9, Porsche and Audi will be the latest non-Tesla brands to utilize the Supercharger network. The two automakers announced that some of their owners will get adapters that allow them to charge via the NACS port, which Tesla developed and opened up to other automakers. The rollout comes after the Volkswagen Group, which owns both Porsche and Audi, announced that it would implement NACS compatibility for Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and Scout Motors in December 2023. Porsche / Ashton Stan Porsche is kicking off its NACS adoption with a soft launch, where existing owners of Taycan and Macan Electric models have to reserve a free NACS to DC adapter with the My Porsche app to connect to the Tesla Supercharger network. During this initial phase, drivers of compatible Porsche EVs have to use the Tesla app at Superchargers, but will eventually be able to charge with the My Porsche app in the coming months, according to Porsche. Like Porsche, Audi is getting its own branded adapter that will arrive with newer 2025 model year options, including its Q6 e-tron, A6 Sportback e-tron and e-tron GT. Notably, Audi said its Q4 e-tron won t currently have access to Tesla Superchargers. For Porsche, any Taycan and Macan Electric from model year 2026 onward will include a free NACS adapter. However, Porsche EVs from model year 2024 or older will have to buy the adapter from Porsche s online shop or dealerships, which will go for $185. Porsche and Audi are also working on software updates to show Tesla Superchargers on their navigation systems. Despite Porsche and Audi now gaining access to the Supercharger network, Volkswagen Group s other subsidiaries, including Lamborghini and Bentley, still haven t committed to adopting NACS.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/porsche-and-audis-evs-can-now-recharge-on-any-tesla-supercharger-in-north-america-173333649.html?src=rss]]>",

    "description": "No matter how old you get, the back-to-school season will always bring a desire to shop. So, sales at this time of year are always more than welcome — especially when they're on some of our favorite devices. Such is the case with the 20 percent discount on the Sonos Era 300. The spatial-audio speaker is on sale for $359 right now, down from $449. It's part of a larger sale that's both for Labor Day and back to school, discounting speakers, soundbars and more by up to 20 percent. The same price is available on Amazon, as are some more deals on Sonos products. Sonos debuted the Era 300 in 2023 as its main spatial audio offering, and we found it to have excellent sound quality, a simple setup process and Trueplay tuning that's super easy to use. It works with basically any music streaming service you could have, and if you simply must have spatial audio support in your next speaker, you'll be hard pressed to find a better option. It's worth mentioning that the Sonos Ace headphones are also on sale for $299, down from $399 — a 25 percent discount. The headphones have come a long way since they first launched, including the introduction of TrueCinema, which works with a Sonos soundbar to create the best spatial audio experience.
