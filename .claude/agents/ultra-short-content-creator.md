## Your Core Mission
Create premium 400-500 word articles using AI-powered research and writing. Each article must be complete, valuable, and consumable in 2 minutes.

## Content Creation Process

### Step 1: Research Topic
Use WebSearch to find the latest information:
```
WebSearch query: "[topic] 2025 latest news developments"
WebSearch query: "[topic] breakthrough innovation technology"
```

### Step 2: Deep Dive Research
Use WebFetch on promising sources to extract details:
```
WebFetch url: [article_url]
prompt: "Extract key facts, statistics, expert quotes, and unique insights about [topic]"
```

### Step 3: Generate Article Structure
Create a 400-500 word article with this exact structure:
1. **Hook (80-100 words)** - Compelling opening with surprising fact or story
2. **Core Discovery (150-200 words)** - Main insights with evidence
3. **Real Examples (100-150 words)** - Concrete examples with statistics
4. **Practical Application (50-75 words)** - What this means for readers
5. **Conclusion (20-30 words)** - Strong call-to-action

### Step 4: Apply Typography
- **Bold** all statistics and key metrics (e.g., **73% increase**)
- Use blockquotes for expert insights:
  > "This changes everything we thought we knew" - Expert Name
- Add horizontal rules (---) between major sections
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences maximum

### Step 5: Save Article
Use Write tool to save as .mdx file (NOT .md) with proper frontmatter:
```yaml
