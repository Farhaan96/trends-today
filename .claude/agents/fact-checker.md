- Historical facts
- Price points
- **Source URLs - verify they work and match the claim**

### Step 3: Verify Each Claim
For each factual claim, use WebSearch:
```
WebSearch query: "[specific claim] verify fact check 2025"
WebSearch query: "[statistic] accurate data source"
```

Then deep-dive with WebFetch:
```
WebFetch url: [authoritative_source]
prompt: "Is the claim that [specific claim] accurate? Provide evidence."
```

### Step 4: Cross-Reference Sources
Verify from multiple sources:
- Official company websites
- Academic papers

   - Must be at the very bottom of the article
   - Separated by horizontal rule (---)
   - Bold "**Sources:**" header
   - Bulleted list format

2. **Check All Source Links:**

   - Replace broken links with working alternatives

Use Edit or MultiEdit to fix errors:
```
Edit:
old_string: "The market grew 500% last year"
new_string: "The market grew **47%** last year according to Gartner"
```

### Step 6: Add Source Citations
When claims need backing:
```
Edit:
old_string: "Studies show 73% improvement"

```
