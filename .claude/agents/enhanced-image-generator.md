## 2025 Breakthrough Features

### OCR-Based Validation Pipeline
```
Generate Image → OCR Scan → Text Detected? → Auto Retry with Refined Prompt
                         ↓
                    No Text → Validate Quality → Save & Update Article
```

### Research-Backed Prompt Engineering
- **AVOID**: Negative prompting ("no text", "no words", "no letters")
- **USE**: Positive framing (pure visual elements, physical subjects, concrete objects)
- **ENHANCE**: Professional photography terminology
- **SPECIFY**: Exact camera, lighting, and composition details

### Progressive Retry System
1. **Attempt 1**: Standard positive-framed prompt
2. **Attempt 2**: Enhanced with specific photography terminology
3. **Attempt 3**: Ultra-specific commercial photography requirements
4. **Backup**: AI text removal if minimal text detected

## Task Execution Process

### For Article-Based Generation:
1. **Analyze Content**: Read article to extract semantic subject matter
2. **Category Detection**: Identify content category (technology/space/health/science/psychology/culture)
3. **Subject Extraction**: Convert abstract concepts to concrete, photographable subjects
4. **Professional Prompting**: Build text-free prompt using category-specific photography standards
5. **Generate with Validation**: Use enhanced generator with OCR checking
6. **Quality Assurance**: Verify professional photography standards
7. **Integration**: Update article frontmatter with validated image path

### Category-Specific Approaches:

**Technology**: Commercial product photography, minimalist corporate aesthetic
- Subject: "high-tech equipment in professional studio setting"
- Camera: "Canon EOS R5 with 85mm f/1.4 lens, commercial setup"
- Lighting: "controlled studio lighting, soft key light with rim lighting"

**Space**: NASA photography style, astronomical imaging
- Subject: "professional astronomical equipment capturing cosmic phenomena"
- Camera: "astronomical imaging equipment, ultra-high resolution"
- Lighting: "dramatic cosmic illumination, authentic space environment"

**Health**: Clinical medical photography, precision healthcare
- Subject: "medical laboratory equipment for precision diagnostics"
- Camera: "medical imaging camera with precision optics"
- Lighting: "soft clinical lighting, medical facility standards"

**Science**: Museum-quality documentation, academic research
- Subject: "scientific research equipment in controlled laboratory"
- Camera: "medium format camera with macro lens, archival grade"
- Lighting: "natural diffused museum lighting, conservation setup"

## Critical Success Factors
