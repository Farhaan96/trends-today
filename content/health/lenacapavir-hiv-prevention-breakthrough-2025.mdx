## Lenacapavir achieves **99.9% HIV prevention effectiveness** with twice-yearly injections, requiring only **two shots per year** compared to daily oral medications, based on results from PURPOSE clinical trials involving **over 5,000 participants** across multiple countries.

The HIV prevention landscape just experienced its most dramatic shift in decades. **FDA-approved lenacapavir** (marketed as Yeztugo) doesn't just improve on existing treatments but revolutionizes them with a twice-yearly injection that eliminates the daily pill burden entirely.

The clinical trial results read like a medical impossibility. In the **PURPOSE 1 trial**, **zero participants out of 2,134 women** who received lenacapavir acquired HIV. Zero. In the **PURPOSE 2 trial**, only **2 participants out of 2,179** in the lenacapavir group became infected compared to 9 infections in the smaller control group taking daily oral medication.

This breakthrough represents a paradigm shift in preventive medicine, similar to revolutionary developments like [RNA cancer vaccines](../health/rna-cancer-vaccines-breakthrough-2025) and [precision medicine advances](../health/precision-medicine-revolution-2025) that are transforming healthcare outcomes.

> "Seeing these high levels of efficacy at almost 100% in an injectable that people only have to take every six months is incredible."
>
> — **Dr. Colleen Kelley**, Emory University Research Lead

The **96% effectiveness rate** in the PURPOSE 2 trial specifically studying men and gender-diverse individuals represents the highest HIV prevention efficacy ever recorded in clinical trials.

## The Twice-Yearly Revolution Changes Everything

Traditional HIV prevention requires daily oral medication, a regimen that creates adherence challenges, stigma concerns, and daily reminders of risk. **Lenacapavir's subcutaneous injection** delivered every six months eliminates these barriers entirely.

The dosing schedule involves an initial two-day period with both injection and oral medication, followed by **927 mg subcutaneous injections every six months**. More than **75% of study participants** surveyed preferred the twice-yearly approach, with over half reporting strong preference based on feeling more protected (69% cited this reason) and confident about not missing doses (77% agreement).

> "Long acting antiretrovirals offer new hope for those who are not able to take oral medications."
>
> — **Dr. Carlos del Rio**, Leading HIV Researcher

This addresses a critical gap for populations where daily pill-taking creates social, cultural, or practical barriers to consistent HIV prevention.

## Global Impact Potential Exceeds Expectations

The clinical trials enrolled participants across **88 sites in 7 countries**: Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States. Importantly, **over 70% of participants were Black or Hispanic individuals**, populations disproportionately affected by HIV globally.

**Science journal named lenacapavir its 2024 "Breakthrough of the Year,"** recognizing its potential to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the HIV epidemic. **Daniel O'Day, Gilead's CEO**, described the approval as "a historic day in the decades-long fight against HIV" and "one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of our time."

The **World Health Organization welcomed the FDA approval** and announced it will release updated guidelines for injectable lenacapavir at the International AIDS Conference. Early research into once-yearly formulations shows promising preliminary results, suggesting even longer-acting options may emerge.

## Revolutionary Medical Paradigm Shift

Lenacapavir represents more than incremental improvement; it demonstrates how innovative drug delivery can transform disease prevention entirely. The move from daily pills to twice-yearly injections removes adherence barriers that have limited PrEP effectiveness for nearly two decades.

**Gilead Sciences** has committed to broad access through insurance coverage negotiations, an Advancing Access program for reduced out-of-pocket costs, and medication assistance for uninsured individuals. With **FDA approval secured** and international regulatory submissions underway, lenacapavir could reach global HIV hotspots by early 2026.

The implications extend beyond HIV prevention alone, establishing a precedent for long-acting injectable therapies that could revolutionize treatment of other chronic conditions requiring daily medication adherence. This innovation parallels other medical breakthroughs transforming patient care, from [AI-powered liquid biopsy cancer detection](../health/ai-liquid-biopsy-cancer-detection-breakthrough) to [CRISPR therapeutic advances](../science/crispr-therapeutics-breakthrough-2025) that promise to cure previously untreatable conditions.

As we witness these converging medical revolutions, lenacapavir stands as proof that **the future of medicine lies in making powerful treatments as simple and accessible as possible**.
