# AI Reads Minds of "Unconscious" Patients

**25% of coma patients labeled "unresponsive" are actually conscious** — they just can't show it.

Now Stony Brook University's revolutionary "SeeMe" AI detects hidden consciousness **4 days earlier** than doctors. The breakthrough reads facial micro-movements invisible to human eyes, potentially saving thousands from premature care decisions.

## The Technology That Sees the Invisible

SeeMe tracks facial pores at **0.2mm resolution** — finer than human hair width. When patients hear commands like "open your eyes" or "stick out your tongue," the AI detects responses doctors miss entirely.

**The results are stunning:**
- **85.7%** detection rate for eye movements vs **71.4%** by doctors alone
- **4.1 days earlier** consciousness detection on average
- **81% accuracy** in identifying specific command responses

> "Just because someone can't move their limbs or speak doesn't mean they aren't conscious. Our tool uncovers those hidden physical efforts by patients to show they are conscious" — Dr. Sima Mofakham, Lead Researcher

## Real Impact on Life-or-Death Decisions

The study analyzed **37 coma patients** with severe brain injuries (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8). SeeMe identified **94.1% of mouth movements** in patients without breathing tubes, revealing consciousness medical teams couldn't detect.

**This matters because:**
- Families make end-of-life decisions based on consciousness assessments
- Early detection guides rehabilitation timing
- Prevents withdrawal of care from aware patients
- Helps predict recovery outcomes

Research published in *Nature Communications Medicine* shows SeeMe-positive responses correlate directly with better discharge outcomes.

## The Future of Consciousness Detection

Next phase: **Yes/no question communication** through facial movements. Dr. Mofakham calls this "a big ethical implication" — conscious patients could participate in their own care decisions.

**Clinical trials expanding** to integrate SeeMe with EEG monitoring for comprehensive consciousness assessment. The technology moves toward standard ICU practice within 2-3 years.

**Bottom line:** Hidden consciousness is more common than we knew, and AI is finally revealing it.
