Scientists have achieved what was once thought impossible: reversing aging at the cellular level and dramatically extending lifespan in elderly mice using a groundbreaking gene therapy that could transform how we approach aging in humans.

**OSK gene therapy uses three Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4) delivered through adeno-associated viruses to reprogram cells to a younger state. In 124-week-old mice (equivalent to 77 human years), the treatment extended remaining lifespan by 109% while improving multiple health markers and reversing aging signatures in both mouse and human cells.**

## The Breakthrough That Changes Everything

Rejuvenate Bio's research team, led by Chief Scientific Officer **Noah Davidsohn**, has accomplished what no one else has done before. Their February 2024 study in _Cellular Reprogramming_ demonstrated that extremely old mice treated with OSK gene therapy lived more than twice as long as untreated mice while showing dramatic improvements in health and vitality.

The treated mice didn't just live longer - they lived better. Frailty scores improved significantly, and DNA methylation clocks (biological markers of aging) showed profound age reversal in heart and liver tissues. When the same treatment was applied to human skin cells from a 65-year-old patient, researchers observed similar age-reversal effects.

## How Cellular Reprogramming Works

The therapy uses a technique called partial reprogramming, which resets the aging clock without erasing cellular identity. This crucial distinction makes the treatment safe and practical. Unlike full reprogramming that turns cells back into stem cells, partial reprogramming maintains each cell's specialized function while reversing age-related damage.

The three factors (OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4) work together to restore youthful gene expression patterns. Scientists deliberately exclude the fourth Yamanaka factor, c-Myc, because it's an oncogene that can cause cancer. This OSK combination provides the benefits of cellular rejuvenation without the tumor risk. The precision of gene editing has advanced dramatically, as demonstrated by doctors who recently [cured an 'incurable' baby with custom CRISPR editing](/health/doctors-cured-incurable-baby-custom-dna-editing).

The delivery system uses adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), the same vectors already approved by the FDA for other gene therapies. These viruses act as molecular delivery trucks, carrying the OSK genes into cells throughout the body where they begin the rejuvenation process. The [FDA's recent fast-tracking of gene therapies](/health/fda-breakthrough-therapy-gene-therapies-rare-diseases-2025) demonstrates growing regulatory confidence in these breakthrough treatments.

## Beyond Mice: The Path to Human Trials

**David Sinclair's** team at Harvard, who pioneered much of the OSK research, is already testing the therapy in monkey eyes for age-related vision loss. If these primate studies prove safe, researchers plan to immediately apply to the FDA for human trials targeting age-related blindness, likely the first indication for human testing.

The approach has shown remarkable results in restoring vision. Mice with glaucoma recovered full sight after just two months of OSK treatment, with benefits lasting nearly a year. Similar success in treating optic nerve damage suggests the therapy could help millions suffering from age-related eye diseases. This breakthrough joins other revolutionary medical advances that are [transforming disease prevention with unprecedented success rates](/health/lenacapavir-hiv-prevention-breakthrough-2025).

In July 2024, Rejuvenate Bio received $4 million from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine to advance their lead candidate, RJB-0402, toward clinical trials. The company is also testing the technology in dogs with heart disease, providing crucial safety data for eventual human applications.

## What Makes This Different

Previous attempts at age reversal faced two major obstacles: cancer risk from the c-Myc factor and the challenge of delivering all four Yamanaka factors in a single treatment. The OSK approach solves both problems while achieving results that surpass earlier efforts.

Unlike treatments that target specific age-related diseases, OSK therapy addresses aging itself, the root cause of numerous conditions from heart disease to neurodegeneration. By reversing cellular aging, the treatment could potentially prevent or reverse multiple age-related diseases simultaneously.

The safety profile appears promising. After 21 months of continuous OSK expression in mice (nearly their entire lifespan), researchers observed no adverse effects or tumor formation. This long-term safety data is crucial for regulatory approval and human translation.

## The Road Ahead

The timeline for human trials has accelerated dramatically. **Life Biosciences**, co-founded by David Sinclair, is preparing to launch the world's first partial epigenetic reprogramming clinical trials in 2025. Their ER-100 therapy uses a fully inducible OSK system that only activates when exposed to doxycycline, allowing precise control over the treatment.

The initial trials will focus on two eye conditions: glaucoma and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). This strategic approach targets diseases where OSK therapy has already demonstrated remarkable success in animal models. Mice with glaucoma recovered full vision that lasted months after treatment.

The regulatory environment is becoming increasingly favorable, with the FDA's 2025 guidance including accelerated approval pathways for gene therapies targeting rare diseases. This could significantly expedite OSK therapy's path to widespread availability.

Beyond eye diseases, researchers envision a staged approach: first treating specific age-related conditions, then expanding to general healthspan and lifespan extension. The technology could fundamentally change how we think about aging, from an inevitable decline to a treatable condition.

The breakthrough represents more than extended lifespan; it's about maintaining health and vitality in later years. As **Daniel Oliver**, CEO of Rejuvenate Bio, notes, this is "the first published work to actually have epigenetic reprogramming extend overall lifespan in normal mice," a milestone that brings the dream of healthy human life extension closer to reality.
