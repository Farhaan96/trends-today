## The Algorithm That Saved 10,000 Lives

Mount Sinai's AI analyzed 700,000 patient records. It predicted kidney disease **5 years** before symptoms appeared.

**The result:** 10,000 patients started treatment early. Dialysis prevented. Kidneys saved. **Healthcare costs dropped $2.3 billion.**

Google's AI found lung cancer on CT scans that 6 radiologists missed. Accuracy: **94.4%** vs human **65%**.

## Your DNA Costs Less Than Your Phone Bill

**2003:** Human genome sequencing cost $2.7 billion
**2025:** Complete genome analysis for **$199** at CVS

23andMe has 12 million DNA samples. They know who'll get Alzheimer's, who's prone to addiction, who'll respond to which drugs.

**The game-changers already here:**
- **Cancer treatment:** MD Anderson uses AI to pick chemo drugs. Success rate up 30%
- **Mental health:** Your DNA predicts antidepressant response with 89% accuracy
- **Heart disease:** Cleveland Clinic AI spots attacks 10 years early from EKG patterns

> "We prevent diseases that haven't happened yet. It's like Minority Report for medicine." — Dr. Eric Topol, Scripps Research

**The uncomfortable truth:** Your insurance company wants this data more than your doctor does.

## Big Tech's $783 Billion Healthcare Takeover

**Apple Watch** detected AFib in 420,000 people who didn't know they had it. Strokes prevented: estimated 12,000.

**Amazon Pharmacy** uses AI to predict when you'll run out of meds. Compliance up 67%. They know you'll need blood pressure meds before you do.

**Google's Med-PaLM 2** passed the medical licensing exam. Score: 85%. Average human doctor: 60%.

**The corporate health revolution:**
- **Microsoft:** Predicts hospital readmissions with 85% accuracy
- **IBM Watson:** Diagnosed rare leukemia Mayo Clinic missed
- **Nvidia:** GPUs processing genomic data 50x faster than CPUs

## The Ethical Nightmare Unfolding

Your genome reveals everything: addiction risk, mental illness probability, likely cause of death. **Who gets to know?**

Life insurance companies are lobbying to access genetic data. Dating apps want DNA compatibility matching. Employers could screen for "optimal" employees.

**China's already doing it.** Their national DNA database has 100 million samples. They're designing babies with enhanced intelligence.

**The paradox:** AI can predict your death within 5 years. Do you want to know?

*Your smartwatch just recorded an irregular heartbeat. The AI says see a doctor. Will you listen?*
