# How AI Predicts Disease: 94% Accuracy

---

## The Algorithm Finding Cancer Doctors Miss

**Harvard's CHIEF AI detected cancer with 94% accuracy** across 11 cancer types.

It outperformed human pathologists on 15 datasets. Mayo Clinic's ECG-AI spots heart disease **10 years before symptoms**. Mount Sinai screened **71,000 patients** — found hidden heart conditions.

**The revolution is here**: FDA already approved multiple AI diagnostic tools.

## Mayo Clinic's Heart Disease Breakthrough

**ECG-AI achievements:**
- **94% accuracy** detecting cardiac abnormalities
- **32% better** first-time detection vs standard care
- **FDA-approved** for clinical use
- Predicts atrial fibrillation, low ejection fraction, HCM

> "AI identifies cardiac abnormalities before structural damage becomes visible," Mayo Clinic confirms.

**Real impact**: 20,000 patients screened. Hundreds of silent heart conditions caught. Lives saved before first symptom.

## Cancer Detection That Changes Everything

**Harvard's CHIEF model:**
- **94% accuracy** across 11 cancer types
- Reads tumor slides better than pathologists
- Predicts molecular profiles from images
- Guides treatment selection

**Mass General's Sybil AI:**
- Forecasts lung cancer **80-95% accurately**
- Detects cancer **before visible on scans**
- Spots changes human eyes can't see

This matches [CRISPR's 97% success](/science/crispr-therapeutics-breakthrough-2025) in treating detected cancers.

## Mount Sinai's Genetic Crystal Ball

**AI + routine blood tests = disease prediction**

Mount Sinai combines:
- Cholesterol levels
- Blood counts
- Kidney function
- Genetic markers

**Result**: Predicts who with mutations will develop disease. **Before any symptoms**.

**MARQO platform** extracts cellular info from tumor slides with "unprecedented accuracy" — accelerating biomarker discovery.

## The $200 Genome Revolution

**Your DNA sequencing now costs less than shoes.**

**2003**: $2.7 billion for human genome  
**2025**: $199 at CVS

**What this enables:**
- **89% accuracy** predicting antidepressant response
- **30% better** cancer treatment selection (MD Anderson)
- Personalized drug dosing based on your genetics

[AI agents process this data](/technology/ai-agents-revolution-13-billion-market-taking-over-2025) instantly.

---

## The Bottom Line

**AI sees disease years before you feel it.**

94% cancer detection. Heart disease spotted a decade early. Genetic risks identified from blood tests. This isn't future medicine — it's happening now at Mayo, Mount Sinai, Harvard.

*Your next checkup might save your life 10 years from now.*
