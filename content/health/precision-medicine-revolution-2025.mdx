# How Precision Medicine Works: 93% Cancer Response Rates

---

## The Treatment That Rewrites Death Sentences

**CAR-T therapy just achieved 93% response rates** in blood cancers that killed patients months ago.

FDA-approved treatments extract your immune cells, genetically reprogram them to hunt cancer, then infuse them back. **67% achieve complete remission**. Not managed. Cured.

---

## The Numbers That Changed Medicine

**Clinical reality today:**
- **30% response rate** vs 4.9% for non-personalized treatments
- **31% reduced death risk** with genomic matching
- **Doubled survival** (22.9 vs 12.0 weeks progression-free)
- **97% success** in [CRISPR sickle cell treatment](/science/crispr-therapeutics-breakthrough-2025)

> "Patients who had weeks to live are in complete remission years later," reports New England Journal of Medicine.

**The $100 billion market** reaches **$200-700 billion by 2030**. This isn't hype — it's happening in hospitals today.

## Where Precision Medicine Wins Now

**1. Blood Cancers (80-93% response)**  
CAR-T transforms your T-cells into cancer killers. Six FDA-approved therapies. Patients dying of lymphoma walk out cancer-free.

**2. Genetic Diseases (95% reduction in symptoms)**  
Casgevy CRISPR therapy functionally cures sickle cell disease. One treatment. Lifetime fix.

**3. Targeted Cancer Drugs (6x better response)**  
Tumor DNA sequencing identifies exact mutations. Matched drugs work **6 times better** than guessing.

[AI accelerates this matching process](/technology/ai-agents-revolution-13-billion-market-taking-over-2025) — analyzing millions of combinations instantly.

## The Reality Check

**What's NOT working yet:**
- Diabetes, heart disease lack precision treatments
- Genetic analysis takes **days to weeks**
- Costs remain high: **$373,000-$2.8 million** for CAR-T
- Access limited to major medical centers

**But for approved conditions?** Game over for traditional approaches.

---

## What This Means for You

**If you have cancer**: Demand genetic testing. **30% response** beats 5% every time.

**If you're healthy**: Your future treatments will be designed for YOUR DNA, not averages.

**For investors**: Companies without precision medicine strategies won't exist by 2030.

---

## The Bottom Line

**Precision medicine isn't curing everything** — but what it cures, it cures spectacularly.

**30% of cancer patients** who would have died are living. Genetic diseases considered death sentences are being erased.

*Your DNA isn't just your blueprint. It's becoming your cure.*
