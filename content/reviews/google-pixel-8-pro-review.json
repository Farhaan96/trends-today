      "question": "How well does Magic Eraser actually work in real-world scenarios?",
      "answer": "Magic Eraser works impressively well for simple objects like people, power lines, and basic background elements. Success rate is about 85% for straightforward removals. However, it struggles with complex shadows, reflections, or intricate backgrounds. The feature works best when the object to remove contrasts clearly with the background and doesn't cast complex shadows.",
      "category": "ai-features"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the Tensor G3 performance really that much worse than competitors?",
      "answer": "Yes, there's a noticeable performance gap in CPU and GPU benchmarks compared to Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and A17 Pro. However, for typical smartphone tasks like browsing, social media, and photography, the difference is minimal. Gaming enthusiasts and users running intensive apps will notice the limitation, but average users likely won't experience significant issues in daily use.",
      "category": "performance"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the camera compare to iPhone 15 Pro for overall photography?",
      "answer": "For pure image quality, both are excellent but take different approaches. Pixel 8 Pro excels in computational photography with unique AI features and superior low-light performance. iPhone 15 Pro offers more natural colors, better video recording, and more consistent results across all scenarios. Pixel is better for creative photography and social media, while iPhone suits professional video work and natural-looking photos.",
      "category": "camera"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the 7 years of updates really guaranteed?",
      "answer": "Yes, Google has made a firm commitment to provide OS updates and security patches for 7 years from the device's launch date (through October 2030). This matches Apple's historical support and exceeds most Android manufacturers. Google controls both the hardware and software, making them well-positioned to deliver on this promise.",
      "category": "updates"
    },
    {
      "question": "How significant is the slow charging speed in daily use?",
      "answer": "The 30W charging speed is noticeably slow compared to competitors. A full charge takes about 80 minutes, while Samsung and OnePlus can charge similarly-sized batteries in 30-40 minutes. For users who charge overnight, this isn't an issue. However, if you need quick top-ups during the day, the slow charging can be frustrating compared to what's available elsewhere.",
      "category": "charging"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I upgrade from Pixel 7 Pro?",
      "answer": "The upgrade depends on your priorities. If you heavily use camera features and want the new AI capabilities like Magic Eraser and Best Take, it's worthwhile. The improved Tensor G3, better display, and guaranteed 7-year support add value. However, if you're satisfied with Pixel 7 Pro performance and camera quality, the improvements may not justify the cost. Consider waiting for Pixel 9 Pro unless you find an excellent trade-in deal.",
