    {
      "question": "How does Galaxy AI compare to Google's Pixel AI features?",
      "answer": "Galaxy AI focuses more on productivity and practical applications like translation and photo editing, while Pixel AI excels in computational photography. Galaxy AI features are more comprehensive across different app categories, but Pixel's camera AI is more sophisticated. Both are useful, but Galaxy AI offers broader utility for daily tasks beyond photography.",
      "category": "ai-features"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the battery life really better than iPhone 15 Pro?",
      "answer": "Yes, consistently. In our testing, Galaxy S24 averaged 8-10 hours of screen-on time compared to iPhone 15 Pro's 6.5-8 hours. The larger 4000mAh battery combined with efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and AI-driven power management provides noticeably longer usage time. However, charging speed is slower than iPhone's peak rates.",
      "category": "battery"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I upgrade from Galaxy S23?",
      "answer": "The upgrade depends on your priorities. If you use AI features heavily, want better battery life, or need the improved camera processing, it's worthwhile. However, if you're satisfied with S23 performance, the improvements are evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Consider waiting for Galaxy S25 unless you find a great trade-in deal.",
      "category": "upgrade"
    },
    {
      "question": "How good is the camera compared to Pixel 8 Pro?",
      "answer": "Both cameras are excellent but take different approaches. Galaxy S24 produces more vibrant, social-media-ready photos with AI enhancements, while Pixel 8 Pro focuses on natural color accuracy and computational photography magic. Galaxy S24 is better for most users who want consistently pleasing results, while Pixel 8 Pro appeals to photography enthusiasts who prefer Google's processing style.",
      "category": "camera"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is One UI still bloated compared to stock Android?",
      "answer": "One UI 6.1 is Samsung's cleanest interface yet, with significantly reduced bloatware compared to previous versions. While it's still not as minimal as stock Android, most of Samsung's additions are genuinely useful. You can uninstall or disable most pre-installed Samsung apps. The experience feels closer to stock Android while retaining Samsung's useful customization options.",
      "category": "software"
    },
    {
      "question": "How reliable are the 7 years of updates?",
      "answer": "Samsung has committed to 7 years of security updates and OS upgrades, matching Google's Pixel promise. While Samsung's update speed has historically been slower than Google's, they've improved significantly and now deliver major updates within 2-3 months of Google's release. The commitment is contractual and covers both security patches and major Android versions.",
