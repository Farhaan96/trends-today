  "howWeTested": "We tested the iPhone 15 Pro for 14 days as a primary device. Testing included daily photography in various conditions, gaming performance with demanding titles, battery life measurements, build quality assessment, and comparison benchmarks against the iPhone 14 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24. All performance metrics were verified across multiple test runs.",
  "verdict": "The iPhone 15 Pro represents a solid but incremental upgrade over its predecessor. The titanium build quality is genuinely impressive and the A17 Pro chip handles everything you throw at it. However, the improvements feel evolutionary rather than revolutionary. If you're coming from an iPhone 12 Pro or earlier, this is definitely worth the upgrade. iPhone 14 Pro users might want to wait another generation unless the titanium build and USB-C are must-haves.",
