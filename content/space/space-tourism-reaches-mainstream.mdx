## The Waiting List That Broke the Internet

Virgin Galactic opened 1,000 seats at $450,000 each. **Sold out in 72 hours.**

They dropped the price to $50,000 for 2027 flights. The website crashed from 2 million simultaneous visitors. **Current waitlist: 12,000 people.**

Blue Origin? **$28 million** for 11 minutes in space. Yet 7,600 people have deposits down.

## The Price War Nobody Expected

**2021:** Virgin Galactic ticket = $450,000
**2025:** Bulk booking discount = $50,000
**2027 projection:** Space flight = $25,000 (cost of a luxury car)

SpaceX just announced **$10,000 tickets** for 2030. Orbital flight. 90 minutes around Earth. Musk called it "cheaper than Disney World, infinitely cooler."

**Who's actually flying:**
- **Celebrities:** Tom Cruise filmed in space, budget: $200 million
- **Scientists:** 47 research missions booked for zero-G experiments
- **Regular people:** Dentist from Ohio won lottery, teacher crowdfunded

> "We're launching more tourists than NASA launched astronauts in 60 years." — Richard Branson

**The shocking stat:** More civilians went to space in 2024 (189) than professional astronauts in history (600 total since 1961). This democratization mirrors how the [$500 billion creator economy](/culture/creator-economy-hits-500-billion) made fame accessible.

## The Space Hotels Already Under Construction

**Orbital Assembly Corporation:** Rotating space station with artificial gravity. 400 guests. **Opens 2028.** Room rate: $5 million for a week.

**Axiom Space:** Luxury module attaching to ISS in 2026. Philippe Starck designed interiors. **$55,000 per night.**

**Blue Origin's Orbital Reef:** Mixed-use business park in space. Amazon Prime delivery included. Jeff Bezos lives there part-time starting 2029.

**The infrastructure boom:**
- **SpaceX Starship:** 100 passengers per flight (currently testing)

## Your Path to Space (It's Closer Than You Think)

**Cheapest options right now:**
1. **Zero-G flights:** $8,000 for weightlessness (no space required)
2. **Balloon to stratosphere:** $125,000, see Earth's curve
3. **Virgin Galactic 2028 slots:** $35,000 if you book today

**Medical requirements (surprisingly minimal):**
- Blood pressure under 140/90
- No recent surgeries
- Can climb 3 flights of stairs
- That's it. 78-year-old went last month.

**Training required:** 3 days. Mostly "don't touch this button" and motion sickness prep. Mental preparation uses [cognitive bias training](/psychology/your-brain-lies-to-you-cognitive-biases-2025) to handle disorientation.

## The Dark Side of Space Tourism

**Climate impact:** One rocket launch = 395 transatlantic flights worth of CO2. Bezos's 11-minute joy ride could have powered 2,000 homes for a year.

**The deaths:** Virgin Galactic: 1 pilot. Blue Origin: 0. SpaceX: 0 civilians (4 professional astronauts). **Still safer than Everest.**

**Space junk crisis:** 12,000 new satellites planned. Kessler syndrome (cascading collisions) could trap us on Earth forever. Meanwhile, companies eye [asteroid mining as the next frontier](/space/asteroid-mining-becomes-reality).

**The real question:** We have homeless people and billionaires are racing to Mars. Priorities?

*Your kids will vacation in space. Your grandkids might live there. The question is: should they?*
