## The Planet That Shouldn't Exist

**TOI-2431 b** completes a year in **5.4 hours**.

**NASA's TESS telescope** found it. Astronomers can't explain it. This planet orbits faster than your workday and it's made of rock, not gas.

---

## The Impossible Statistics

**TOI-2431 b** by the numbers:\*\*

- **Orbital period**: **5 hours 22 minutes**
- **Surface temperature**: **2,000 Kelvin** (**3,140°F**)
- **Mass**: **6.2 Earth masses**
- **Density**: **9.4 g/cm³** (**denser than iron**)
- **Distance from star**: **0.0063 AU** (**100x closer** than Earth to Sun)

> "This planet exists where nothing should survive."
>
> — **NASA's exoplanet team**

**The mystery**: How did it form? Planets can't form this close to stars because it's **too hot, too chaotic**. Yet here it is.

## A World of Liquid Rock

**What happens on TOI-2431 b:**

- Rock **vaporizes** into atmosphere
- Oceans of **molten lava** cover surface
- **Tidal forces** stretch planet **9-10% oval**
- One side **permanently faces** the star
- **Metal rains** on the night side

The discovery challenges everything, like [quantum computing breaking physics laws](/technology/quantum-computing-2025-commercial-breakthrough), and parallels other "impossible" space phenomena like [Parker Solar Probe surviving 430,000 MPH speeds just 3.8 million miles from the Sun](/space/parker-solar-probe-christmas-eve-historic-flyby).

## Why This Discovery Matters

**TOI-2431 b** proves we don't understand planets.

**Current theories say** it should have:

- **Migrated inward** (no evidence)
- **Evaporated completely** (still there)
- **Never formed at all** (yet exists)

**What we're learning**: Ultra-short period planets are common. **33 confirmed** so far. All breaking formation models.

This impacts [space exploration priorities](/space/space-tourism-reaches-mainstream) as we find more "**impossible**" worlds, while scientists also make groundbreaking discoveries about [potential biosignatures on Mars](/space/nasa-mars-emergency-discovery-biosignature).

---

## The Death Spiral

**TOI-2431 b** is doomed.

**Tidal forces** drag it closer every orbit. In **10 million years**, it crashes into its star. We're watching **a planet die in real-time**.

**The bigger question**: How many planets like this existed? How many already died?

---

---

## The Bottom Line

**TOI-2431 b** exists. **Physics says it shouldn't.**

Every **5.4 hours**, this **lava world** completes another impossible orbit. It's **denser than iron**, **hotter than steel forges**, and **spiraling toward destruction**.

**If this planet can exist, what else is out there?**
