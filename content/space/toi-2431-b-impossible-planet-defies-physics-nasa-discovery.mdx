# What Is TOI-**2431 b**: The 5.4-Hour Year

## The Planet That Shouldn't Exist

**TOI-**2431 b** completes a year in 5.4 hours.**

NASA's TESS telescope found it. Astronomers can't explain it. This planet orbits faster than your workday — and it's made of rock, not gas.


---


---


## The Impossible Statistics

**TOI-**2431 b** by the numbers:**
- **Orbital period**: **5 hours **22 m**inutes**
- **Surface temperature**: **2,**000 K**elvin** (3,140°F)
- **Mass**: **6.2 Earth masses**
- **Density**: **9.4 g/cm³** — denser than iron
- **Distance from star**: **0.0063 AU** — **100x **closer than Earth to Sun


> "This planet exists where nothing should survive,

> " confirms NASA's exoplanet team.

**The mystery**: How did it form? Planets can't form this close to stars — too hot, too chaotic. Yet here it is.

## A World of Liquid Rock

**What happens on TOI-**2431 b**:**
- Rock **vaporizes** into atmosphere
- Oceans of **molten lava** cover surface
- **Tidal forces** stretch planet 9-**10%** oval
- One side **permanently faces** the star
- Metal **rains** on the night side


The discovery challenges everything, like [quantum computing breaking physics laws](/technology/quantum-computing-2025-commercial-breakthrough).


---


---


## Why This Discovery Matters

**TOI-**2431 b** proves we don't understand planets.**

**Current theories say** it should have:
- Migrated inward (no evidence)
- Evaporated completely (still there)
- Never formed at all (yet exists)


**What we're learning**: Ultra-short period planets are common. **33 confirmed** so far. All breaking formation models.

This impacts [space exploration priorities](/space/space-tourism-reaches-mainstream) as we find more "
impossible" worlds.

## The Death Spiral

**TOI-**2431 b** is doomed.**

Tidal forces drag it closer every orbit. In ****10 million** years**, it crashes into its star. We're watching a planet die in real-time.

**The bigger question**: How many planets like this existed? How many already died?


---


---


## The Bottom Line

**TOI-**2431 b** exists. Physics says it shouldn't.**

Every 5.4 hours, this lava world completes another impossible orbit. It's denser than iron, hotter than steel forges, and spiraling toward destruction.

*If this planet can exist, what else is out there?*
