# NASA Found a Lava World with a 5.4-Hour Orbit That Shouldn't Exist

## The Planet That Broke Every Rule

TOI-2431 b shouldn't exist. Yet there it is.

[NASA's TESS telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tess/index.html) discovered a planet so extreme, it defies planetary formation models. **TOI-2431 b completes an entire orbit in just 5.4 hours** — faster than a workday on Earth.

The stats are mind-bending: **6.2 Earth masses** crammed into **1.53 Earth radii**, creating a density of **9.4 g/cm³** — denser than iron.

## A World of Molten Rock

This isn't just another hot planet. It's a cosmic furnace.

**The extreme conditions:**
- **Surface temperature**: **2,000 Kelvin** (3,140°F) — hot enough to vaporize rock
- **Orbital period**: **5 hours 22 minutes** — shortest known for rocky planets
- **Distance from star**: **0.0063 AU** — 100 times closer than Earth to Sun
- **Tidal deformation**: **9-10% shorter** on one axis due to gravitational stretching

> "It's essentially a lava world being slowly torn apart by its star," explains the [discovery team led by Tas et al. (2025)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/525/1/1091/7230663). "We're witnessing planetary destruction in slow motion."

## Why It Shouldn't Exist

Three physics violations make TOI-2431 b "impossible":

**1. Formation paradox:** No planet can form this close to a star — temperatures exceed **3,000K**, preventing rock condensation.

**2. Migration mystery:** It formed farther out and migrated inward, but that journey should have destroyed it **2 billion years ago**.

**3. Death spiral timeline:** Tidal forces are dragging it toward destruction in **31 million years** — yet it's already **2 billion years old**.

The planet sits [just outside the Roche limit](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/) where tidal forces would tear it apart. It's literally living on borrowed time.

## What This Means for Planetary Science

TOI-2431 b rewrites the textbooks on three fronts:

**Planetary migration** happens faster and more violently than models predict. [Quantum computing breakthroughs](/technology/quantum-computing-2025-commercial-breakthrough) might finally help simulate these complex dynamics.

**Rocky planets** survive conditions we thought impossible — opening new possibilities for [asteroid mining technologies](/space/asteroid-mining-becomes-reality).

**Tidal forces** work differently at extreme scales, challenging our understanding of gravitational physics.

---

## The Bottom Line

Every astronomy model just became suspect.

**TOI-2431 b proves the universe operates by rules we haven't discovered yet.** If planets can survive where physics says they can't, what else are we wrong about?

*In 31 million years, TOI-2431 b will spiral into its star and vanish. Until then, it stands as proof that the cosmos loves breaking our rules.*
