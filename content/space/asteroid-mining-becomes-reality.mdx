# When Will Asteroid Mining Start: It Already Has

## AstroForge’s $55M Bet Launches January 2025

**California startup AstroForge just launched Odin spacecraft** to asteroid 2022 OB5.

Their timeline:
- **2023**: Refinery test in orbit
- **January 2025**: Odin surveys 2022 OB5
- **Late 2025**: Vestri lands on asteroid
- **$55.6 million** raised (Nova Threshold led $40M Series A)

**The market**: **$2.58 billion in 2025**. Projected **$39 billion by 2040** (19.5% CAGR).

## NASA Brought Back 121 Grams, Worth Billions

**OSIRIS-REx delivered** 121.6 grams from asteroid Bennu in September 2023.

**Psyche launches October 2023**, arrives **August 2029**. The metal asteroid worth:
- **$10,000 quadrillion** in iron and nickel (theoretical)
- More metal than Earth’s entire economy for 10,000 years
- Problem: Can’t bring it back (yet)

**Total asteroid samples returned to Earth**: 127 grams. That’s it. After 25 years of missions.

## Who’s Actually Mining Space

**Active players:**
- **AstroForge** — $55M raised, 3 missions planned
- **ispace** (Japan) — Moon mining, $195M raised
- **Planetary Resources** — Bankrupt 2018
- **Deep Space Industries** — Acquired by Bradford Space

**Government missions:**
- **NASA Psyche** — Exploration only, no mining
- **China Tianwen-2** — Sample return 2027
- **UAE asteroid mission** — 2028 launch

## The $10 Quintillion Reality Check

**Why it’s hard:**
- **Launch costs**: $2,720/kg to orbit
- **Travel time**: 2-6 years per mission
- **Refining in space**: Never been done
- **Return payload**: Grams, not tons

**What’s actually valuable:**
- **Platinum group metals** (rare on Earth)
- **Water** (rocket fuel in space)
- **Helium-3** (fusion reactors)

**Market growth**: 24.9% CAGR through 2034. [AI revolutionizes planning](/technology/ai-agents-revolution-13-billion-market-taking-over-2025) but can’t beat physics.

## The Bottom Line

**Asteroid mining starts 2025** — but returns won’t.

AstroForge lands on asteroid this year. NASA explores Psyche in 2029. Market hits $39 billion by 2040. But bringing back tons of metal? Physics says decades.

*Investment tip: Buy the shovels, not the gold rush.*
