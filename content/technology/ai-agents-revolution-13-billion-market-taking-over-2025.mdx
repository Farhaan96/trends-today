## Why AI Agents Are Different This Time

These aren't your father's chatbots. Modern AI agents:

**Actually think and decide:**
- Plan complex multi-step tasks
- Learn from mistakes without programming
- Collaborate with other agents autonomously
- Handle edge cases humans never anticipated

**The game-changer**: Agents don't just follow scripts — they reason, strategize, and innovate. Google's latest agent wrote **40%** of its own codebase improvements.

## The Companies Going All-In

**Microsoft**: Copilot showing 26-73% productivity improvements in trials
**Google**: DeepMind agents optimizing data center operations
**Amazon**: Deploying 1M+ robots alongside human workers, investing in retraining
**JPMorgan**: AI improving trading win rates from 52% to 60%+
