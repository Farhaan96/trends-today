# How Google AI Mode Works in Hindi, Japanese, Korean

---

---

## **2 Billion** New Users Just Got AI Access

**Google** activated **AI Mode for 5 new languages** on **September 8, 2025**.

**Gemini 2.5** now powers: **Hindi**, **Japanese**, **Korean**, **Indonesian**, and **Brazilian Portuguese**. This follows launches in **US** (May), **India** (June), and **UK** (July).

## Why These Languages Win

**The strategic targets:**

**Hindi**: **600 million** speakers, India's tech boom
**Japanese**: **125 million** speakers, **$5 trillion economy**
**Korean**: **80 million** speakers, highest internet penetration
**Indonesian**: **200 million** speakers, Southeast Asia's giant
**Portuguese**: **260 million** speakers, Brazil's digital market

> "Locally relevant and useful search experiences with advanced multimodal reasoning."
>
> — **Google AI Product Team**

**The breakthrough**: Not translation - **cultural context**. **Gemini 2.5** understands regional nuances, slang, and formal registers naturally.

## The Technical Edge

**What Gemini 2.5 delivers:**

- **Multimodal processing** in native languages
- **Complex reasoning** without translation
- **70+ languages** in Google Translate
- **Live conversations** across languages

**November 2024**: Workspace added **7 languages**. Now AI Mode reaches **2 billion potential users**.

Meanwhile, the [**$7.9 billion AI agent market**](/technology/ai-agents-revolution-13-billion-market-taking-over-2025) goes global with multilingual capabilities.

## The Competition Falls Behind

**Google's strategic timeline:**

- **November 2024**: Workspace expansion
- **May-July 2025**: US, India, UK rollout
- **September 2025**: 5-language global launch

**OpenAI** focuses on English. **Google** captures Asia and Latin America.

> "**80%** of internet users don't speak English as their first language."
>
> — **Internet World Stats Research**

## What This Means

**AI is no longer English-only**. **Google** just secured **2 billion users** while competitors scramble.
