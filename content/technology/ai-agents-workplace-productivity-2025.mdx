- Fix edge cases from pilot
- Expand to **25%** of team
- **67% of users** adopt within 5 days when properly trained

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions

**Reality check from enterprise deployments:**
- **Setup time**: **40-80** hours per agent
- **Monthly costs**: **$125** per user (Salesforce Agentforce) to **$50** per user (basic tools)
- **Maintenance**: **5-10 hours/month** ongoing
- **Training**: Average **3.4 days/week** usage after proper training
