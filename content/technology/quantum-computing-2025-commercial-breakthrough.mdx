# How Google's Willow Quantum Computer Works

---

---

## **5 M**inutes vs 10 Septillion Years

**Google's Willow chip solved a problem in **5 m**inutes** that would take classical computers **10 septillion years**.

That's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. The universe is only **14 billion** years old.

## What Makes Willow Different

**The breakthrough stats:**

- **105 qubits** with \***\*99.857%** accuracy\*\*
- **Error correction that improves** as you add qubits
- **2-**5x **better** than previous quantum systems
- **Exponential error suppression** achieved

>

> "Quantum computers now do things classical computers fundamentally cannot,"
> confirms Google Quantum AI.

**The game-changer**: Every other quantum computer gets **worse** with more qubits. Willow gets **better**. First time ever.

## What's Actually Working Now

**Real deployments today:**

- **Volkswagen**: Optimizing Lisbon traffic with quantum
- **Goldman Sachs**: Researching derivatives pricing
- **Roche**: Discovering new antibiotics
- **Google**: Simulating fusion reactions

**What's NOT working yet:**

- **RSA encryption**: Needs \***\*1 million** qubits\*\* (Willow has 105)
- **Drug discovery**: Helps specific simulations, not entire pipelines
- **Weather forecasting**: Limited by 7-10 day chaos theory

The [**$7.9 billion** AI agent market](/technology/ai-agents-revolution-13-billion-market-taking-over-2025) arrives faster than quantum threats.

---

---

## The Reality Check

**McKinsey predicts**: Quantum advantage by **2030s**, not tomorrow.

**IBM** rushed their 1000-qubit announcement. **Microsoft** restarted their program. **China** claims superiority without proof.

> "Significant competitive advantages in the 2030s," McKinsey confirms.

For now, prepare with [quantum-resistant authentication](/technology/web3-authentication-replaces-passwords) and watch [precision medicine advances](/health/precision-medicine-revolution-2025).

---

---

## The Bottom Line

**Quantum works but isn't magic**. Willow proves quantum superiority for specific problems.

Encryption is safe for years. Drug discovery gets incremental help. Weather stays unpredictable past a week.

\*Revolutionary? Yes.

World-ending? Not yet.
