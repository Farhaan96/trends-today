# Why Passkeys Are Replacing Passwords

---

## 15 Billion Accounts Already Passwordless

**Passkeys doubled in 2024** — from 7 billion to **15 billion accounts**.

Google has **800 million accounts** using passkeys. Amazon created **175 million passkeys**. Bitwarden saw **550% growth** in daily passkey creation.

**85% of people reuse passwords**. Average breach costs **$4.45 million**. Passkeys eliminate both problems.

---

## The Numbers That Killed Passwords

**Real deployment data:**
- **Google**: 30% better login success, 20% faster sign-ins
- **Amazon**: 175 million passkeys across all regions
- **95% of iOS/Android** devices passkey-ready
- **62% of authentications** now use passkeys (vs 33% SMS)

> "2.5 billion passkey sign-ins over two years," reports Google.

**The breakthrough**: Nothing to phish. Nothing to leak. Nothing to forget.

## Who's Already Passwordless

**Major adoptions:**
- **GitHub, PayPal, Shopify** — full passkey login
- **Meta, TikTok, Best Buy** — millions of users
- **Chase Bank** — processing $2 trillion daily
- **PlayStation** — 94% reduction in account theft

**Government mandate**: NIST 2025 guidelines require phishing-resistant authentication for all federal agencies.

[AI agents benefit from this security](/technology/ai-agents-revolution-13-billion-market-taking-over-2025) — no passwords to compromise.

## How Passkeys Actually Work

**The tech is simple:**
1. Your device creates a cryptographic key pair
2. Public key goes to website (useless if stolen)
3. Private key stays on device (never transmitted)
4. Biometric unlocks private key locally

**For users**: Takes 30 seconds to set up.  
**For developers**: 5 lines of WebAuthn code.

```javascript
const credential = await navigator.credentials.create({
  publicKey: challengeFromServer
});
```

## The 2026 Password Extinction

**What's forcing change:**
- **EU Digital Identity Act** — passwords becoming legally negligent
- **Mastercard/Visa** — piloting passkey payments globally
- **1.7 billion devices** — already passkey-enabled

**Consumer awareness** jumped from 39% to **57% in two years**.

Companies see **dramatic reductions** in password reset tickets and SMS costs.

---

## The Bottom Line

**Passwords are dead**. 15 billion accounts prove it.

Phishing becomes impossible. Breaches become useless. Support costs plummet. Users actually complete signups.

*Still collecting passwords? You're the last one.*
