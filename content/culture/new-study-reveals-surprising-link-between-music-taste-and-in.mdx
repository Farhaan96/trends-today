# Does Music Taste Indicate Intelligence: What Research Actually Shows

---

## Instrumental Music Fans Have Higher IQs

**Croatian researchers tested 467 high school students** — the results surprised everyone.

Students with higher intelligence scores preferred:
- **Instrumental music** (no vocals)
- **Classical and jazz**
- **Ambient/chill electronica**
- **Film soundtracks**

**The correlation is real** — but tiny. Personality traits matter more than IQ.

## Harvard Debunks the Mozart Effect

**The myth**: Listening to classical music makes you smarter.

**Harvard's reality check**:
- Original "Mozart effect" was just **2.1 IQ points**
- Effect lasted only **15 minutes**
- **80% of adults** believe this myth despite no evidence
- Music lessons showed **2.7 IQ point** gain after a full year (barely significant)

> "Music training had no effect on cognitive abilities of young children" — Samuel Mehr, Harvard researcher

**The truth**: Smart people like instrumental music. Music doesn't make them smart.

## SAT Scores Reveal Genre Rankings

**Actual data from student SAT scores:**
1. **Techno** — Highest scores
2. **Classic Rock**
3. **Country**
4. **Rock**
5. **Rap**
6. **R&B**
7. **Classical** (middle, not top)
8. **Alternative**
9. **Reggae**
10. **Pop**
11. **Hip Hop**
12. **Jazz**
13. **Gospel**
14. **Soca** — Lowest scores

**Plot twist**: Classical isn't at the top. Techno listeners scored highest.

## Why Smart People Like Wordless Music

**Dr. Satoshi Kanazawa's theory**:

Intelligence evolved to handle **novel stimuli**. Instrumental music is more "novel" evolutionarily — humans sang before creating instruments.

**The correlation factors:**
- **Novel preference** — High IQ individuals seek new experiences
- **Complexity processing** — Instrumental music demands pattern recognition
- **Less distraction** — No lyrics means pure musical analysis

[Introverts show similar preferences](/psychology/why-introverts-excel-at-deep-work-psychology-research-2025) for low-stimulation environments.

## The Bottom Line

**Music preference correlates weakly with IQ** — correlation coefficient usually under 0.1.

What matters more:
- **Personality traits** (openness to experience)
- **Education level**
- **Family income**
- **Age and gender**

**Learning an instrument**: Only **10% IQ boost** according to some studies. [Cognitive biases](/psychology/your-brain-lies-to-you-cognitive-biases-2025) make us overestimate these effects.

*Your playlist doesn't define your intelligence — but instrumental music fans do score slightly higher.*
