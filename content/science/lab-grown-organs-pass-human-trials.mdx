# What Are Xenotransplants: Pig Organs Save Lives

---

## Alabama Woman Lives 3 Months With Pig Kidney

**Towana Looney went home with a functioning pig kidney** — the longest survivor yet.

NYU transplanted a **gene-edited pig kidney** into her on November 25, 2024. Three months later, she's alive with normal kidney function. Two previous patients died within months.

**88,000 Americans** wait for kidneys. **17 die daily**. Pigs might be the answer.

## The Gene-Edited Pig Revolution

**2024's xenotransplant scorecard:**
- **March**: Richard Slayman gets pig kidney at Mass General (survived 2 months)
- **April**: Lisa Pisano receives pig kidney + heart pump at NYU (kidney removed after 47 days)
- **November**: Towana Looney gets UKidney at NYU (still thriving)

> "We're the longest-living person with a pig kidney" — Towana Looney, 3 months post-transplant

**The genetic edits**: 10-69 modifications remove pig antigens that trigger rejection. No more waiting for human donors.

## FDA Approves First Multi-Patient Trials

**United Therapeutics starts mid-2025:**
- **6 patients** receive UKidney (10 gene edits)
- **eGenesis** approved for 3-patient trial (69 gene edits)
- **Both companies** use CRISPR-edited pigs

**3D bioprinting reality check**: We're **20-30 years** from printing complex organs. Harvard created blood vessels with 4,000km of capillaries — but only in labs.

[AI predicts organ failure](/health/personalized-medicine-using-ai) years early, buying time for xenotransplants.

## What Actually Works Today

**Success stories:**
- **3D-printed bladder** (1999) — still functioning 25 years later
- **Mini-kidneys** for drug testing — Wake Forest lab success
- **Ear prosthetics** from patient cells — 3DBio clinical trial

**Coming soon:**
- **2025**: Routine cartilage and skin printing
- **2027**: Pig organ transplants at scale
- **2030+**: Complex 3D-printed organs (maybe)

> "In 10 years, simple organs like skin. Hearts and kidneys? Much longer" — Prof. Tal Dvir, Tel Aviv University

---

## The Bottom Line

**Pig organs work** — 3 living patients prove it. But success varies wildly. Towana Looney thrives while others died within months.

FDA-approved trials start 2025. **103,000 Americans** on transplant lists watch closely. The technology exists. The pigs are ready.

*Your next kidney might oink.*
