**Quick answer (45 words):** University of Portsmouth physicist **Melvin Vopson** documented viruses losing information entropy in 2025 experiments, behavior he calls the **Second Law of Infodynamics**. That finding suggests the universe runs compression algorithms, yet astrophysicists say the energy to simulate reality would still exceed known cosmic reserves.

A single question now drives the debate: does entropy prove we live in a simulation, or are we misreading thermodynamics?

## Vopson's Second Law Says Reality Optimizes Code

**SARS-CoV-2 mutation logs showed information entropy dropping** instead of rising across thousands of samples. Vopson argues only a system running compression routines would prefer tidy data, so he proposed the **Second Law of Infodynamics** to describe a universe that prunes redundancy like software.

> "A super complex universe like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a built-in data optimization and compression... This is exactly what we are observing all around us."

> - Dr. Melvin Vopson, University of Portsmouth

**Updated data as of 16 September 2025:** Vopson reports similar compression signatures in planetary rings and linguistic networks.

## Energy Math Still Fights Simulation Theory

Astrophysicist Erin Choban's team calculates the observable universe stores **3.5 x 10^124 bits** of information. Perfectly simulating that state would demand **8.9 x 10^108 ergs** - more energy than exists. Even modeling Earth alone would need power rivaling **the gravitational binding energy of the Milky Way**, so many cosmologists reject the holodeck idea.

**Important caveat:** those limits assume classical machines. Quantum effects might reduce the bill, but no evidence shows a viable path yet.

## Quantum Experiments Blur the Line

Google's latest [quantum simulations](/technology/quantum-computing-2025-commercial-breakthrough) manipulate **58-qubit** lattices to generate matter phases classical hardware cannot reach. Quanta Magazine reports researchers flipping between analog and digital quantum processors like game engines, reinforcing the sense that reality already behaves like modular code.

That tension shows up everywhere from [impossible planets](/space/toi-2431-b-impossible-planet-defies-physics-nasa-discovery) to AI labs. Entropy hints at simulation design, while energy math keeps the brakes on.

## What It Means for You

For builders, the safest move is to apply the compression lessons whether or not reality is simulated. Mirror the data-paring logic in AI systems, add transparency checks like [your brain misreads reality](/psychology/your-brain-lies-to-you-cognitive-biases-2025), and watch how [AI agents reshape productivity](/technology/ai-agents-workplace-productivity-2025). The simulation debate is now a blueprint for smarter infrastructure rather than a late-night thought experiment.
