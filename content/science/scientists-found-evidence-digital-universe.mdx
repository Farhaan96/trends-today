## **University of Portsmouth physicist Melvin Vopson** discovered **SARS-CoV-2 mutations** decrease **information entropy** instead of increasing it, suggesting reality runs **compression algorithms** like computer software. However, **astrophysicist F. Vazza** calculated that **simulating Earth alone** would require energy equivalent to **unbinding all matter in the Milky Way**.

The question dividing science: does **entropy prove we're living in code**, or do **energy constraints** make **universal simulation impossible**?

## The Compression Evidence

**SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations** showed something **impossible according to traditional physics**. Instead of **information entropy increasing over time** as the **Second Law of Thermodynamics** predicts, **Dr. Melvin Vopson** from the **University of Portsmouth** documented entropy **decreasing across thousands of viral samples**.

His **October 2023 study** in _AIP Advances_ established the **"Second Law of Infodynamics"** - a principle suggesting **information systems naturally compress data** to optimize **storage and processing power**. This discovery parallels how [Google's Willow quantum computer](quantum-computing-2025-commercial-breakthrough) processes information through **quantum compression algorithms**.

> "A **super complex universe** like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a **built-in data optimization and compression** in order to reduce the **computational power** and the **data storage requirements** to run the simulation. This is exactly what we are observing all around us, including in **digital data**, **biological systems**, **mathematical symmetries** and the **entire universe**."

> â€” **Dr. Melvin Vopson**, **University of Portsmouth Physics Department**

**Vopson's research between 2023-2024** found similar **compression patterns** in **planetary ring formations**, **genetic sequences**, and **mathematical symmetries** throughout nature. The behavior mirrors how **software algorithms** eliminate redundant code to run more efficiently - a pattern that extends to how [our brains optimize information processing](cognitive-disengagement-multitasking-brain-shutdown) through **protective shutdown mechanisms**.

## The Energy Impossibility

**Dr. F. Vazza's** **April 2025 study** in _Frontiers in Physics_ delivered **crushing numbers**. His team calculated that **simulating Earth alone** requires energy equivalent to **unbinding all matter in the Milky Way**. Each **computational timestep** demands roughly the **same amount of energy dissipation**.

**The mathematics are unforgiving**: a **universal simulation** would require **more energy than exists** in the **observable cosmos**. Even with **quantum computing advantages**, no viable pathway emerges to power such a system.

**Classical computers** hit the wall immediately. **Quantum effects** might reduce **energy requirements**, but **Vazza's constraints** suggest even **quantum machines** cannot bridge the gap between **simulation ambition** and **cosmic energy budgets**. This contrasts sharply with discoveries of [impossible planets like TOI-2431 b](toi-2431-b-impossible-planet-defies-physics-nasa-discovery) that **defy known physics** yet somehow exist.

## Google's Quantum Bridge

**Google's quantum computing breakthroughs** add complexity to the debate. Their systems manipulate **58-qubit lattices** to generate **matter phases impossible for classical hardware**, switching between **analog and digital quantum processors** like modular game engines.

These experiments demonstrate **reality behaving like code** - **programmable, modular, optimizable**. Yet they also consume **enormous energy** for relatively simple simulations, supporting **Vazza's energy constraints** rather than contradicting them. The implications extend to [AI agents revolutionizing computation](ai-agents-revolution-13-billion-market-taking-over-2025) with **$7.9 billion market adoption**.

## What This Means

The **entropy evidence** suggests our **universe optimizes information** like **sophisticated software**. The **energy calculations** prove we cannot **simulate such complexity** with **known physics**.

**Both findings may be correct**. Reality might follow **compression algorithms** without being **artificially generated**. **Natural systems** could have evolved **data optimization** as a **fundamental property**, not evidence of **digital creation**.

**For technology developers**: apply these **compression insights** to **AI systems** and **data management**. **For philosophers**: prepare for a universe that **acts like code** whether or not it **is code**. This parallels how [cognitive research reveals](your-brain-lies-to-you-cognitive-biases-2025) our brains use **information shortcuts** and **optimization algorithms** for survival.
