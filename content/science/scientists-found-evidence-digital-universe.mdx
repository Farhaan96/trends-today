When University of Portsmouth scientist **Melvin Vopson** analyzed virus mutations during the pandemic, he discovered something that shouldn't exist according to traditional physics. **Information entropy was actually decreasing** – a phenomenon that could prove we're living inside a computer simulation. His breakthrough **"Second Law of Infodynamics"** suggests the universe operates like a vast data compression system, optimizing information just like any digital program would.

This isn't science fiction anymore. Vopson's research reveals that **biological systems**, **mathematical patterns**, and even **cosmic structures** all follow **digital optimization principles** that mirror computer algorithms. The implications are staggering: if our reality operates on information compression, we might be experiencing what he calls a **"built-in data optimization system"** designed to reduce computational load.

> "A super complex universe like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a built-in data optimization and compression in order to reduce the computational power and the data storage requirements. This is exactly what we are observing all around us."

But here's where it gets mind-bending. **The observable universe contains approximately 3.5 × 10^124 bits of information** – that's a number with **124 zeros**. Recent **2025 research** published in Frontiers in Physics calculated that simulating this would require **8.9 × 10^108 erg of energy**, more than exists in the entire observable universe. Even simulating just **Earth** would need energy equivalent to **the potential binding energy of our entire galaxy**.

The quantum computing revolution adds another twist. **Google's latest quantum breakthroughs** can now simulate **58-qubit systems** that create previously impossible states of matter. These [quantum simulations](/technology/quantum-computing-2025-commercial-breakthrough) are revealing **exotic particles** and behaviors that classical computers could never model, suggesting our universe might operate on **quantum computational principles** we're only beginning to understand.

Scientists are divided into two camps. **Vopson's team** argues that **symmetry patterns and entropy reduction** throughout nature prove digital origins. Meanwhile, **astrophysicists** demonstrate that simulation theory violates **fundamental energy conservation laws** – making it physically impossible for any civilization to create our reality artificially, much like the [impossible physics-defying planets](/space/toi-2431-b-impossible-planet-defies-physics-nasa-discovery) astronomers keep discovering.

The race to solve this puzzle intensifies as **quantum computers approach practical applications in 2025**. If we can simulate complex universes ourselves, does that make our own simulated existence more likely? Or does the **astronomical energy requirement** prove we're definitely living in base reality? Perhaps our brains aren't equipped to process this reality – after all, [our cognitive biases already distort every decision](/psychology/your-brain-lies-to-you-cognitive-biases-2025) we make.

Whether we're digital beings or not, this research is **revolutionizing physics** and pushing the boundaries of what's computationally possible. As [AI agents transform workplace productivity](/technology/ai-agents-workplace-productivity-2025) by **55%**, the line between digital and physical reality continues to blur. The answer might determine **the very nature of existence itself**.
