After nearly four decades of international collaboration, scientists have completed the magnet system that will cage plasma hotter than the sun's core. The achievement marks humanity's closest approach yet to controlling the power source of stars.

## ITER's newly completed central solenoid generates **13 Tesla** of magnetic force, powerful enough to levitate an aircraft carrier **2 meters** off the ground. This **1,000-ton** superconducting magnet will confine plasma at **150 million degrees Celsius** when the reactor achieves first plasma in **2035**.

The completion represents the convergence of precision engineering from **33 nations**, years of materials science innovation, and manufacturing tolerances as tight as **0.2 millimeters**.

## The Magnet That Could Cage the Sun

At the heart of the ITER tokamak in southern France stands the most powerful pulsed electromagnet ever constructed. The central solenoid towers **18 meters high**, assembled from six cylindrical modules that each required over **two years** of precision fabrication.

Each module contains approximately **6 kilometers** of niobium-tin superconducting cable wound into intricate patterns. Japan produced the specialized superconductor strands, while American facilities in California completed the final module assembly and testing in April 2025.

The magnetic field strength reaches **13 Tesla** at the solenoid's core, approximately **280,000 times** stronger than Earth's natural magnetic field. This immense force serves a singular purpose: controlling superheated plasma that would instantly vaporize any physical container.

## Engineering Plasma Hotter Than Stars

Nuclear fusion requires three critical conditions simultaneously. Plasma must reach **150 million degrees Celsius**, maintain sufficient particle density, and sustain confinement long enough for atomic nuclei to overcome their natural repulsion and fuse.

The central solenoid works in concert with **18 massive toroidal field coils** that encircle the vacuum vessel. Each D-shaped coil weighs **330 tons** and measures **17 meters tall**, making them the largest niobium-tin magnets ever produced.

Together, these magnet systems will:

- **Confine plasma particles**: Preventing contact with reactor walls
- **Induce plasma current**: Heating the fuel to fusion temperatures
- **Maintain stability**: Controlling turbulence that could disrupt reactions
- **Enable burning plasma**: Sustaining fusion through self-heating

The complete magnet system stores **41 gigajoules** of magnetic energy while operating at cryogenic temperatures of **4.5 Kelvin**, maintained by liquid helium cooling.

## From Materials to Megawatts

The path from concept to completion required solving unprecedented engineering challenges. Manufacturing the toroidal field coils demanded **4.57 kilometers** of conductor per coil, wound into **134 turns** with submillimeter precision.

At critical interfaces, tolerances reached **Â±0.2 millimeters**, requiring extraordinary manufacturing control. A single misalignment could compromise the entire magnetic containment system when subjected to forces capable of lifting warships.

The central solenoid alone incorporates **9,000 individual parts** from **8 U.S. suppliers**, each component verified through rigorous testing protocols. When fully assembled, the solenoid will sustain a plasma current of **15 megaamperes**, driving the fusion reaction forward.

This international collaboration saw Russia, Europe, China, and the United States each contributing specialized components. Japan's advanced niobium-tin production proved essential for achieving the superconducting properties required for sustained operation.

## The Promise of Fusion Power

ITER aims to demonstrate fusion's viability by producing **500 megawatts** of fusion power from only **50 megawatts** of input heating power. This tenfold energy gain would create a self-sustaining "burning plasma" where fusion reactions generate enough heat to maintain themselves.

Recent progress accelerated in 2024, with ITER achieving **100 percent** of construction targets. In April 2025, the first vacuum vessel sector module entered the Tokamak Pit **three weeks ahead** of schedule, signaling momentum toward the **2035** first plasma milestone.

The reactor will initially operate with hydrogen before transitioning to deuterium-tritium fuel by **2039**. If successful, ITER won't generate electricity for the grid but will prove fusion can produce net energy, paving the way for commercial reactors.

Related breakthroughs in [quantum battery technology](/technology/quantum-battery-breakthrough-charges-seconds-stores-energy-1000-times-longer) and [advanced materials science](/science/materials-defy-physics-laws-impossible-properties) demonstrate how fundamental research continues reshaping energy's future. The race to achieve [commercial fusion energy](/science/nuclear-fusion-breakthroughs-clean-energy-2025) continues to accelerate alongside ITER's progress.

## Racing Toward First Light

The completion of ITER's magnet system removes a critical barrier on the path to controlled fusion. With assembly now accelerating in southern France, the world's largest fusion experiment inches closer to its defining moment.

When plasma first illuminates the tokamak chamber in 2035, it will mark not just a technological milestone but a fundamental test of whether humanity can harness the power that lights the stars. The magnets are ready. The engineering is sound. Only time and physics remain.
