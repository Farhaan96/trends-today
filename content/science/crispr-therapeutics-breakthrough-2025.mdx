**CRISPR just delivered what medicine promised for decades.**

**FDA-approved Casgevy** eliminates sickle cell crises in **97% of patients**. This isn't managing symptoms — it's **rewriting DNA** to delete disease.

One dose. No more hospital visits. No more pain crises.

Patients spending lives in agony are **crisis-free for 12+ months**.

## The Treatment That Works

**How Casgevy actually works:**

1. Extract patient's stem cells
2. **Edit DNA** to produce fetal hemoglobin
3. Chemotherapy clears old cells
4. Infuse edited cells back
5. New healthy blood cells take over

**The breakthrough results:**

- **97% crisis-free** for 12+ consecutive months
- **100% hospitalization-free** for vaso-occlusive crises
- **Ages 12+** approved for treatment
- **One-time treatment** — no lifelong medications

> "Patients describe it as being reborn. Years of pain, gone after one treatment."
>
> — **New England Journal of Medicine**, 2024

## Beyond Sickle Cell

**What CRISPR cures today:**

**Beta Thalassemia** — **90% eliminate** monthly blood transfusions. Lifetime dependence ended.

**In Clinical Trials:**

- **Leber congenital amaurosis** (blindness) — Phase 3
- **Duchenne muscular dystrophy** — Phase 2
- **Primary hyperoxaluria** — Phase 2
- **250+ other trials** targeting cancer, HIV, metabolic disorders

The **$3.2 billion CRISPR market** reaches **$8-17 billion by 2030**. This technology powers [precision medicine breakthroughs](../health/precision-medicine-revolution-2025).

## The Reality Check

**What CRISPR can't do yet:**

- **Cost**: **$2.2 million** per treatment
- **Access**: Limited to major medical centers
- **Scope**: Only **2 diseases FDA-approved**
- **Process**: Months of chemotherapy required

**But for sickle cell and thalassemia?** It's a **functional cure**.

---

## What This Means

**For patients**: Genetic diseases aren't destiny anymore. **97% success** changes everything.

**For medicine**: We can now **edit human DNA successfully**. The implications are staggering.

**For the future**: **250+ trials underway**. Cancer, blindness, muscular dystrophy — all targets.

[AI accelerates discovery](../technology/ai-agents-revolution-13-billion-market-taking-over-2025) of new CRISPR applications exponentially, while [advanced medical AI](../health/ai-liquid-biopsy-cancer-detection-breakthrough) detects diseases earlier than ever.

---

## The Bottom Line

**CRISPR works. Today. In real patients.**

Two diseases down, hundreds to go. We're witnessing **medicine's biggest leap since antibiotics**.

_Your genes aren't your fate. They're now **editable code**._
