## ITER Assembly Accelerates with Critical 2025 Milestones

The world's largest fusion experiment achieved remarkable progress in 2025, defying critics who questioned the international collaboration's ability to deliver results. **Westinghouse Electric Company** secured the **$180 million vacuum vessel assembly contract** in June, taking responsibility for ITER's most critical component.

The vacuum vessel represents fusion's ultimate engineering challenge. This **double-walled steel container** must maintain perfect vacuum conditions while withstanding **100 million degree plasma** and intense neutron bombardment. Westinghouse's expertise in nuclear reactor construction positions them to complete assembly by **2027**.

ITER's assembly pace dramatically improved throughout 2025:

- **Sector Module #7**: Installed in April after just **seven months** of assembly
- **Sector Module #6**: Previously required **18 months** using older methods
- **Assembly acceleration**: New techniques cut construction time by **60%**
- **Two sectors installed**: Standing side-by-side in the tokamak pit with **15 cm spacing**

The **35-nation collaboration** now targets **first plasma in 2034**, followed by **deuterium-tritium operations in 2039**. While delayed from original 2025 targets, this timeline provides crucial validation data for commercial fusion development.

## Commonwealth SPARC: Private Fusion's Fastest Track

Commonwealth Fusion Systems transformed 2025 into their breakthrough year, reaching **65% completion** on their SPARC demonstration reactor outside Boston. The company's aggressive timeline puts them on track for **first plasma in 2026** and **net energy gain by 2027**.

SPARC's revolutionary design uses **high-temperature superconducting magnets** generating **20 Tesla magnetic fields** — nearly twice ITER's strength in a reactor **one-third the size**. This compact approach dramatically reduces construction costs while maintaining fusion performance.

Critical 2025 milestones included:

- **Cryostat base installation**: **75-ton stainless steel foundation** positioned in March
- **Superconducting tape delivery**: **3,300 km** of **VIPER tape** received, one-third of total requirements
- **Component testing**: Major systems validated ahead of assembly
- **Eni power agreement**: **$1 billion contract** for future electricity sales

The **MIT spinoff** raised **$863 million** in Series B2 funding, bringing total investment to **$3 billion**. This financial backing supports both SPARC demonstration and ARC commercial reactor development targeting the **early 2030s**.

## Helion Energy's Commercial Reality Check

While ITER and Commonwealth focus on tokamak designs, **Helion Energy** pursues alternative fusion technology with the industry's most aggressive commercial timeline. Their **Polaris prototype** successfully demonstrated **direct electricity generation** from fusion reactions in mid-2025.

Helion's **field-reversed configuration** approach bypasses traditional steam turbines, converting fusion energy directly to electricity. This innovative method could deliver **higher efficiency** and **lower operational complexity** than competing designs.

**2025 construction milestones** at their Washington state facility include:

- **Site preparation begun**: **50-megawatt Orion reactor** groundbreaking
- **Microsoft partnership**: **2028 power delivery contract** signed
- **Polaris validation**: **Seventh-generation prototype** testing completed
- **$425 million funding**: Series F round completed, over **$1.3 billion total raised**

The company's timeline claims **commercial fusion by 2028**, potentially beating both ITER and Commonwealth to market. However, their **hydrogen-boron fuel cycle** remains unproven at commercial scale, representing higher technical risk than deuterium-tritium alternatives.

## TAE Technologies: Alternative Fusion Pathway

**TAE Technologies** represents fusion's third major approach, using **field-reversed configuration** with **hydrogen-boron fuel** that produces no neutron radiation. Their **Copernicus reactor** began operations in 2025, testing this innovative fusion pathway.

The company's unique advantages include:

- **No radioactive waste**: Hydrogen-boron reactions produce only helium
- **Direct energy conversion**: Eliminates steam turbine inefficiencies
- **Compact design**: Smaller footprint than tokamak reactors
- **$1.79 billion funding**: Substantial private investment secured

TAE targets their **Da Vinci commercial reactor** for **grid-ready operations in the early 2030s**. While later than Helion's 2028 timeline, this approach could offer superior safety and waste profiles for widespread deployment.
