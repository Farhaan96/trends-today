# Why LK-99 Failed: The Superconductor That Fooled Everyone

---

## Chinese Academy Confirms: It's Just a Semiconductor

**LK-99 is officially dead.** After **2000+ replication attempts** worldwide, zero succeeded.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences published the death certificate in November 2024: LK-99 is a **semiconductor with Cu2S impurities**, not a superconductor. The ferromagnetic properties fooled initial tests.

**The highest real superconductor**: Lanthanum decahydride at **-23°C** under **200 GPa pressure**. Still needs Antarctica-level cold and crushing pressure.

## The Physics That Exposed the Lie

**What superconductors must show:**
- Zero electrical resistance
- Meissner effect (magnetic field expulsion)
- Critical temperature jump
- Josephson tunneling

**What LK-99 actually showed:**
- Partial levitation (from ferromagnetism)
- Resistance drop (from Cu2S phase transition at 127°C)
- No Meissner effect
- No flux pinning

> "LK-99 undergoes structural transition at 400K from Cu2S impurities, not superconductivity" — Prof. Luo Jianlin, Chinese Academy

**The smoking gun**: Cu2S transitions from hexagonal to monoclinic structure at exactly the temperature LK-99 showed changes.

## Real Progress: Cuprates at 130K

**Actual breakthroughs in 2024:**
- **Japanese (Hg,Re)1223 cuprate** — Works at **130K** (-143°C)
- **Harvard twisted cuprates** — New manipulation method for exotic states
- **Iron-based (Ba,K)Fe2As2** — **38K** with **1000 A/mm²** current

**Still requires**: Liquid nitrogen cooling. [Quantum computers need similar cooling](/technology/quantum-computing-2025-commercial-breakthrough) — the physics is unforgiving.

## The $50 Billion Reality Check

**20 companies** manufacture real superconductors:
- **YBCO wires** for MRI machines
- **Maglev trains** in Japan (500 km/h)
- **ITER fusion reactor** magnets

**Timeline to room temperature**:
- **Optimists**: 10-20 years
- **Realists**: 30+ years
- **Physicists**: "Maybe never"

> "We're either overly enthusiastic or deceptive about room temperature superconductivity" — Elie Track, HYPRES CTO

## The Bottom Line

**LK-99 taught us this**: Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. After 2000 failed replications, the verdict is final.

Room temperature superconductors remain science fiction. The real progress happens at -143°C with cuprates, not viral preprints.

*Still waiting for the revolution? Keep your liquid nitrogen handy.*
