      "answer": "The Samsung Galaxy S24 consistently delivered the best battery life in our testing, easily lasting a full day with 6-8 hours of screen time. The Pixel 8 and Nothing Phone (2) also performed well. iPhone models, while optimized, have smaller batteries."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth buying a flagship smartphone in 2025?",
      "answer": "Flagship smartphones offer the best cameras, performance, and longest software support. If you keep phones 3+ years and use demanding apps or take lots of photos, flagships are worth it. For basic use, mid-range phones offer 90% of the experience at half the cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is 5G in smartphone selection?",
      "answer": "All phones on our list support 5G. In practice, 5G coverage varies significantly by location. It's good to have but shouldn't be a primary buying factor since LTE is still fast enough for most tasks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I wait for the next generation or buy now?",
      "answer": "If your current phone works fine, waiting 6 months for new releases can be smart. However, smartphones have reached maturity - the improvements between generations are incremental. Buy when you need it rather than chasing the latest specs."
