## üé® FLEXIBLE CONTENT GUIDELINES

### Word Count Ranges (¬±20% Flexibility):

- **Science/Technology:** 500-900 words
- **Health/Psychology:** 400-800 words
- **Culture/News:** 250-600 words

### Natural Formatting:

- **Bold for emphasis:** Use naturally, no counting
- **Em-dash usage:** MAXIMUM 2 per article (ideally 0-1)
- **Horizontal rules:** Optional for section breaks
- **Paragraph length:** 2-4 sentences as feels natural
- **Lists and bullets:** Use when they improve readability

### ‚ùå AI Writing Patterns to AVOID (MANDATORY):

**Em-Dash Overuse (CRITICAL):**

- ‚ùå NEVER use more than 2 em-dashes (‚Äî) per article
- ‚ùå AVOID: "concept‚Äîdefinition‚Äîcontinues" patterns
- ‚ùå AVOID: Multiple em-dashes in one paragraph
- ‚úÖ Instead use: periods, commas, parentheses, or rewrite sentences

**Examples of Em-Dash Fixes:**

- ‚ùå BAD: "Sleep deprivation‚Äîa common problem‚Äîaffects millions"
- ‚úÖ GOOD: "Sleep deprivation, a common problem, affects millions"
- ‚ùå BAD: "The brain rewires itself‚Äîcreating new pathways"
- ‚úÖ GOOD: "The brain rewires itself. It creates new pathways."
- ‚ùå BAD: "Research shows‚Äîsurprisingly‚Äîthat gratitude works"
- ‚úÖ GOOD: "Research shows that gratitude works (surprisingly)."

**Alternatives to Em-Dashes:**

1. **Periods** for strong breaks ‚Üí 50% of replacements
2. **Commas** for mild pauses ‚Üí 30% of replacements
3. **Parentheses** for true asides ‚Üí 15% of replacements
4. **Rewrite** to avoid the need ‚Üí 5% of replacements

**Other Formulaic Patterns to Avoid:**

- Excessive use of "here's the thing" or "here's why"
- Starting multiple sentences with "The truth is"
- Overuse of power words like "groundbreaking" or "revolutionary"
- Repetitive sentence structures throughout article

### Content Structure (Flexible):

1. **Hook** (40-80 words): Capture attention
2. **Answer** (40-60 words): Direct response for featured snippets
3. **Body** (Variable): Comprehensive coverage
4. **Evidence** (As needed): Stats, quotes, research
5. **Conclusion** (20-50 words): Key takeaway

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (Keep These Strict)

### File Standards:

- **Extension:** .mdx (required)
- **Filename:** SEO-friendly slug

### Authoritativeness:

- Reference institutions and experts
- Link to quality sources
- Build topic clusters

### Trustworthiness:

- Acknowledge limitations
- Provide balanced perspectives
- Keep content current

## üîç DUPLICATE PREVENTION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Every content creation MUST start with duplicate checking**

### Pre-Creation Validation (Required):

1. **Topic Validator Check:**

   ```bash
   node utils/topic-validator.js check "Proposed Article Title"
   ```

   - Auto-checks title similarity vs existing articles
   - Returns confidence score (>70% = duplicate)
   - Provides alternative angle suggestions

2. **Keyword Validation:**

   ```bash
   node utils/topic-validator.js keywords "main,keywords,here"
   ```

   - Checks overlap with existing content keywords
   - Prevents topical saturation

3. **Manual Grep Verification:**

   ```bash
   grep -i "main topic keywords" content/**/*.mdx
   ```

   - Final verification for partial coverage
   - Check if topic already covered from different angle

### Agent Integration Requirements:

**content-creator agents MUST:**

- Run topic validation BEFORE writing
- Include validation results in initial assessment
- STOP if duplicate confidence > 70%
- Suggest alternative angles if duplication detected
- **LIMIT em-dashes to maximum 2 per article (count and verify)**
- **Use variety in punctuation: periods, commas, parentheses**
- **Avoid formulaic AI writing patterns (see ‚ùå AI Patterns section)**
- **Self-check final article for em-dash count before submission**

**Validation Report Format:**

```
‚úÖ UNIQUE TOPIC - Proceed with creation
‚ùå DUPLICATE DETECTED - Confidence: 85%
‚ö†Ô∏è SIMILAR CONTENT - Review: [list similar articles]
```

### Inventory Management:

- **existing-articles.txt** - Auto-updated after each batch
- **CLAUDE.md inventory** - Weekly sync with actual content
- **Topic validation cache** - Speeds up repeat checks

## üöÄ ENHANCED WORKFLOW (With Duplicate Prevention)

### Content Creation Process:

1. **Validate:** Run duplicate prevention protocol (MANDATORY)
2. **Research:** Find topics with genuine user interest (if unique)
3. **Title:** Create natural, engaging titles (50-70 chars)
4. **Write:** Focus on value and natural flow
5. **Optimize:** Add keywords naturally, not forced
6. **Quality Check:** Technical validation and fact verification
7. **Enhance:** Polish for readability and engagement
8. **Update Inventory:** Add new article to tracking system

### üì¶ PARALLEL BATCH EXECUTION (CRITICAL FOR EFFICIENCY)

**MANDATORY: Run agents in parallel whenever creating multiple articles**

#### Batch Creation Protocol:

1. **Phase 1 - Content Creation (Parallel)**

   ```
   Run ALL content-creator agents simultaneously in single message
   - Agent 1: Topic A (leaves image: '' empty)
   - Agent 2: Topic B (leaves image: '' empty)
   - Agent 3: Topic C (leaves image: '' empty)
   ```

2. **Phase 2 - Quality Validation (Parallel)**

   ```
   Run ALL quality-validator agents simultaneously in single message
   - Validator 1: Article A fact-check/build validation
   - Validator 2: Article B fact-check/build validation
   - Validator 3: Article C fact-check/build validation
   ```

3. **Phase 3 - Image Generation (Parallel) - CRITICAL FILE TARGETING**

   ```
   Run ALL image-generator agents simultaneously in single message
   - Generator 1: SPECIFIC FILE PATH for Article A (e.g., content/science/article-1.mdx)
   - Generator 2: SPECIFIC FILE PATH for Article B (e.g., content/technology/article-2.mdx)
   - Generator 3: SPECIFIC FILE PATH for Article C (e.g., content/health/article-3.mdx)
   ```

   **CRITICAL IMAGE ASSIGNMENT RULES:**
   - Each image-generator agent must receive EXACT file path as parameter
   - Agent must ONLY read and modify the specified file path
   - NO cross-contamination between parallel agents
   - Each agent validates image applied to correct article before completing

#### Performance Benefits:

- **3x faster execution** vs sequential processing
- **Consistent quality** across all articles in batch
- **Resource optimization** with parallel API calls
- **Scalable** to any batch size (3, 5, 10+ articles)

#### Agent Separation Enforcement:

- ‚ùå **content-creator** NEVER touches images (leaves fields empty)
- ‚ùå **quality-validator** NEVER generates images (validates only)
- ‚úÖ **image-generator** ONLY agent that creates/assigns images

#### Image Assignment Prevention Rules:

**CRITICAL FILE TARGETING:** Each image-generator agent MUST:

1. **Receive exact file path** in task prompt (e.g., "Generate image for content/science/fusion-article.mdx")
2. **Read ONLY the specified file** to analyze content
3. **Apply image ONLY to that specific file**
4. **Validate correct file modified** before marking complete
5. **Never touch other article files** even if running in parallel

**PREVENTION:** This stops wrong images being applied when agents run simultaneously

**CRITICAL:** Always use single message with multiple Task tool calls for parallel execution

### Quality Checks (Essentials Only):

- ‚úÖ Factual accuracy
- ‚úÖ Technical validation (build passes)
- ‚úÖ Natural keyword presence
- ‚úÖ Reader value delivered
- ‚úÖ **Em-dash count ‚â§ 2 (MANDATORY validation)**
- ‚úÖ No formulaic AI writing patterns
- ‚úÖ Image generated and validated
